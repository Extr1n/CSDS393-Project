Scholars and activists, especially those interested in racial and gender equity, over the past two decades have raised interest in a broad set of contemplative practices that can address suffering and social justice issues in teaching, research and activism. What role does contemplative practices and spiritual activism play in efforts for social justice and social change? What might practices of social transformation look like when rooted in love and compassion? This course explores these questions among others, and examines the role of contemplative practices and spirituality for individuals and collectivities engaged in transformative social justice work.\nWe explore the increasing incorporation of contemplative practices and 'self-recovery' approaches into current social justice movements including Black Lives Matter, indigenous land claims, feminism, LGBTQ rights, etc. In turn, we also examine how activists bring new insights and questions to traditional practices and use practices rooted in decolonizing efforts. In particular, we focus on the work of contemporary feminist, womanist and women of color scholars and activists.

    "description": "Race and Racism will discuss the classical and contemporary understandings of the concepts of race and racism. We will begin by taking an historical approach, delving into processes of racialization and the first instances where distinctions in human race were noted. We will survey theories of race and use a social constructions approach to examine how sociologists approach the study of racial and ethnic group difference. We will examine how definitions of racial groups have evolved over time and differ across contexts, as well as some of the underlying social and structural processes that create racial hierarchies. At the end of the course students should have a strong understanding of the mechanisms that reproduce systems of racial classification. The course will also examine patterns and trends in racial and ethnic inequality over recent decades, centering our discussion on the legacies of racism, current discrimination, and new processes that are currently unfolding to reproduce inequality.While the course's main focus is to examine understandings of race and racism in the United States, we will devote some attention to how race and ethnicity emerge in different environments by examining race and racism in an international context.\nOffered asAFST\u00a0386,SOCI\u00a0386andSOCI\u00a0486.

We will discuss topics such as medicalization of the aging body, elder care and government responses to population aging, political economy of the aging experience, the role of technology in elder care, death and dying, as well as ageism in our society. Beliefs and practices surrounding aging is a fundamental component of every society. Studies of the aging experience offer a valuable lens through which to understand issues such as family and gender relations, social inequality, state governance, and discrimination and social injustice.\nOffered asANTH\u00a0304andANTH\u00a0404.

The sub-field seeks to understand how cultures, including our own, organize and structure these activities through institutions, rituals, and beliefs systems. However, unlike the formal approach of the field of economics, the in-depth methods of economic anthropology concentrate on day-to-day experiences of what the economic means, how this is defined, and what we can learn about human behavior through it.\n\nThis course will introduce students to economic anthropology and some of the major questions and challenges this field addresses. The history of this sub-field, how it relates to economic sociology, and areas where economic anthropology and traditional economics overlap, will also be explored. This class does not present economic anthropology and modern economics as adversaries, instead how and why they are fundamentally different orientations with often seemingly little in common. On this backdrop, this class will survey a number of different topics, including: health commodification; gift exchange; commodity chains; the history of money and debt; why objects have value; how people make ends meet; rational vs. non-rational decision-making; behavioral economic experiments conducted in other cultures; development economics, and why some objects and services have prices while others do not.\nOffered asANTH\u00a0325andANTH\u00a0425."

Beginning with the earliest hunter-gatherer populations, archaeological data reveal a diversity of cultural changes/adaptations in South Asia resulting in the indigenous development of sedentary agricultural societies coexisting with hunters and gatherers, and with pastoral nomadic groups interacting over diverse econiches.  These cultural developments resulted in the formation of the Harappan (Indus Valley) culture - a unique, ancient (2600-1300 BC) Old World civilization.  Archaeological data indicate this Harappan culture provided basic fundamental cultural traits that evolved into the culturally Early Historic Indian Tradition.

Ethnographic research seeks to understand and describe the experiences of research participants (i.e. subjects) through becoming involved in their daily lives.  Findings from ethnography are generated through systematic observation within the natural context in which behavior occurs (i.e. fieldwork).  Unlike methods that emphasize detachment, distance, and objectivity, ethnography involves developing knowledge by becoming an ad hoc member of the group(s) one is studying.  The principal techniques of ethnography, \"participant-observation\" and \"In-depth open ended interviewing,\" require actively engaging the research process.  This class will explore ethnographic research techniques, as well as other qualitative research methods.  In addition to addressing how such methods make claims about social phenomena, this class will also explore more practical topics such as: developing questions, entering the field, establishing rapport, taking and managing field notes, coding data, and data analysis.

Are there cultural patterns or clusters of ideas underlying the deleterious actions of modern culture towards the natural world that could be clarified through a comparison with indigenous or traditional cultures, some who lived sustainably for thousands of years and even enhanced the biodiversity of their surrounding environments? If cybernetic and semiotic principles that guide living systems were clarified, would this lead to more ecologically robust ways of engaging with the natural world and resolving contemporary sustainability issues? Is it the essential task of our time to develop and globalize an ecologically, socially, and economically sustainable \"beyond modern\" definition of human being? Is the global environment decay of our earthly home perhaps a clarion call by nature, compelling our species to integrate the wisdom of traditional knowledge along with the spectacular scientific and technological achievements of modernity if we are to survive?

    "description": "Now that the environmentally deleterious effects of modern Western culture on the natural world have reached major proportions it has become crucial to explore innovative solutions to this dilemma.  In this course novel perspectives derived from the intersection of anthropology and ecology are discussed.  The primary perspective focused upon is the understanding that human culture and the natural world in which it is embedded are essentially communicative, or semiotic processes, which thrive upon diverse interaction and feedback.  Preserving and restoring the Natural World thus shifts from protecting individual species and particular cultural practices to enhancing the communicative matrix of life and multiple cultural views of the environment.  Through this understanding, students will learn to apply a more elegant, effective, and aesthetically pleasing perspective to the challenging environmental issues facing our contemporary world.  An in-depth examination of the North American Prairie, along with a comparison of influences on the landscape by indigenous and modern Western Culture will serve as the particular region of focus.\nOffered asANTH\u00a0382andANTH\u00a0482.

The sub-field seeks to understand how cultures, including our own, organize and structure these activities through institutions, rituals, and beliefs systems. However, unlike the formal approach of the field of economics, the in-depth methods of economic anthropology concentrate on day-to-day experiences of what the economic means, how this is defined, and what we can learn about human behavior through it.\n\nThis course will introduce students to economic anthropology and some of the major questions and challenges this field addresses. The history of this sub-field, how it relates to economic sociology, and areas where economic anthropology and traditional economics overlap, will also be explored. This class does not present economic anthropology and modern economics as adversaries, instead how and why they are fundamentally different orientations with often seemingly little in common. On this backdrop, this class will survey a number of different topics, including: health commodification; gift exchange; commodity chains; the history of money and debt; why objects have value; how people make ends meet; rational vs. non-rational decision-making; behavioral economic experiments conducted in other cultures; development economics, and why some objects and services have prices while others do not.\nOffered asANTH\u00a0325andANTH\u00a0425."

    "description": "This is a course on applying ethnographic research methods in the social sciences.  Ethnographic research seeks to understand and describe the experiences of research participants (i.e. subjects) through becoming involved in their daily lives.  Findings from ethnography are generated through systematic observation within the natural context in which behavior occurs (i.e. fieldwork).  Unlike methods that emphasize detachment, distance, and objectivity, ethnography involves developing knowledge by becoming an ad hoc member of the group(s) one is studying.  The principal techniques of ethnography, \"participant-observation\" and \"In-depth open ended interviewing,\" require actively engaging the research process.  This class will explore ethnographic research techniques, as well as other qualitative research methods.  In addition to addressing how such methods make claims about social phenomena, this class will also explore more practical topics such as: developing questions, entering the field, establishing rapport, taking and managing field notes, coding data, and data analysis.

Are there cultural patterns or clusters of ideas underlying the deleterious actions of modern culture towards the natural world that could be clarified through a comparison with indigenous or traditional cultures, some who lived sustainably for thousands of years and even enhanced the biodiversity of their surrounding environments? If cybernetic and semiotic principles that guide living systems were clarified, would this lead to more ecologically robust ways of engaging with the natural world and resolving contemporary sustainability issues? Is it the essential task of our time to develop and globalize an ecologically, socially, and economically sustainable \"beyond modern\" definition of human being? Is the global environment decay of our earthly home perhaps a clarion call by nature, compelling our species to integrate the wisdom of traditional knowledge along with the spectacular scientific and technological achievements of modernity if we are to survive?

    "description": "Now that the environmentally deleterious effects of modern Western culture on the natural world have reached major proportions it has become crucial to explore innovative solutions to this dilemma.  In this course novel perspectives derived from the intersection of anthropology and ecology are discussed.  The primary perspective focused upon is the understanding that human culture and the natural world in which it is embedded are essentially communicative, or semiotic processes, which thrive upon diverse interaction and feedback.  Preserving and restoring the Natural World thus shifts from protecting individual species and particular cultural practices to enhancing the communicative matrix of life and multiple cultural views of the environment.  Through this understanding, students will learn to apply a more elegant, effective, and aesthetically pleasing perspective to the challenging environmental issues facing our contemporary world.  An in-depth examination of the North American Prairie, along with a comparison of influences on the landscape by indigenous and modern Western Culture will serve as the particular region of focus.\nOffered asANTH\u00a0382andANTH\u00a0482.

In what sense can we speak of medieval multiculturalism? Is Americo Castro's optimistic model of convivencia (coexistence) valid, or is Brian Catlos' idea of conveniencia (convenience) more accurate? In this course we will study cultural theory, medieval and modern historiography, and literature from medieval Castile to the present to approach an understanding of Medieval Iberian 'multiculturalism.'  \nThis class will allow students to get in contact with the history of Spain through the study of the presence and influence of the Roman Empire, the Jewish and Muslim cultures and religions in the Peninsula. Through literature, cinema and art students will learn how the Spanish civilization and culture developed through the years. \nThe class will be offered during a regular semester, with a study abroad component at the end of it.

    "description": "The purpose of this course is twofold: It is a course that allows students an in-depth look at the diverse women who represent a number of cultures in the Arab world in nations from the Mashrek to the Maghreb. The second primary goal of the course is to study such women through the eyes of leading Arab women theorists who have made an impact not only in their own countries, but also on disciplines intersecting with women's studies worldwide. We will study the Arab woman's place in her respective society, in political and economic systems, in education, and in the family. We will also analyze her contributions to art and literature as well as to the sciences. The course will provide an overview of the Arab woman throughout history, from her origins to her place within recent movements within the Arab Spring and other current world events. As Arab women are Muslim, Christian, and Jewish, views of women within these major world religions will also be taken into account as we study the Arab woman as well as religion's impact on culture in the Middle East and in the Maghreb in particular. In the course, we will utilize theoretical texts, but also case studies as well as examples from media and the arts. During the semester, we will take advantage of teleconferencing opportunities between CWRU and two major academic units for Women's Studies in the Arab world: The Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World (IWSAW) in Beirut, Lebanon, and the University of Jordan's Center for Women's Studies in Amman.\nOffered asFRCH\u00a0337,FRCH\u00a0437,ARAB\u00a0337,ETHS\u00a0337andWGST\u00a0337.

From statues and paintings to oil lamps with erotic scenes, drinking cups with images of famous athletes, and even travel souvenirs, Romans were surrounded by images and objects that allowed them to participate in but also shape and resist a broader imperial culture. Students will consider how art and architecture shaped the complex ways that people living in the Roman world related to the empire and to regional and local cultural traditions from Egypt and North Africa, Northern Europe, and the Near East.

The culture industries (along with many other sectors) have been forced to re-examine the viability and utility of their current models, and the assumptions these models are predicated upon. Art institutions are in the process of reconciling their complicated and often contradictory relationship with white, sexist, ableist, and classist ideology, in which they have tacitly perpetuated dominant structures and perspectives while rhetorically advocating for reform and radical change. In this course, we will explore this contemporary cultural moment and unravel the seismic changes that have brought uncertainty to the art world. We will speculate potential futures free of racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, and classism, and the role that art could play within those possible futures. And we will explore alternative conceptions of art with the potential to instigate those futures through a focus on social engagement, community, and radical inclusion.\nOffered asARTH\u00a0310,ARTH\u00a0410,ARTS\u00a0300, andARTS\u00a0400."

Produced in west-central Mexico, these astounding objects--which combine Roman subject matter with distinctly Indigenous motifs and techniques--speak to the visual consequences of Mexico's status as both a colonial possession of Spain, and as a vital bastion of artistic innovation. This course uses objects like this one as a point of departure to investigate the art of the Iberian world--a world that extended far beyond the European continent during the 16th-18th centuries. In this course we will focus on the nexus of transpacific and transatlantic trade that facilitated the production of objects like the batea. We will explore the ways that maps, illustrated travelogues, frescos, paintings and prints worked alongside decorative objects such as feathered headdresses, weapons, and carved ivory statuettes in order to interrogate the place of material culture in the formation of knowledge. Readings will be drawn from art history, anthropology, and sociology and will highlight decolonial methodologies for understanding racial representation and the history of collecting.

    "description": "People often single out the reign of Constantine (A.D. 306-337) as the point in history when Rome transformed from a polytheistic empire to a Christian empire. This course questions the strict divide between the categories of \"pagan\" and \"Christian\" in Rome in the imperial period and beyond. Through a close examination of the artistic and architectural record, students will come to understand that this dichotomy is a modern invention; for people living in the Roman Empire, religious identities were extraordinarily fluid. Indeed, traditional polytheistic religion and Christianity remained closely intertwined for centuries after Constantine \"Christianized\" the Empire. Moreover, religious pluralism had been a fundamental part of Roman culture since the founding of ancient Rome. We will survey a range of material culture, including public statuary, sarcophagi, silver hordes, and temples and churches. We will also examine sites such as the border city of Dura-Europos in Syria to explore how religious identities in the Roman Empire (including Judaism, early Christianity, and so-called mystery cults) intertwined even when Rome was still supposedly a \"pagan\" Empire. The course pays particular attention to the art and architecture produced under Constantine, whom people today often remember as Rome's first Christian emperor but who represents, in fact, a complex amalgam of polytheistic and monotheistic practices and identities. We will also explore how Christian art slowly but ultimately became the predominant visual culture in the Roman Empire. Finally, we will examine how Early Islamic art and architecture exploited the Greco-Roman visual tradition to the ends of this new religion.\nOffered asARTH\u00a0325,ARTH\u00a0425andCLSC\u00a0325.

This course examines the many ways that Romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 B.C.E. to the reign of Constantine (306-337 C.E.). Why did Romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape Romans' military values? What can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the Roman world? We will explore major public monuments in the city of Rome (including triumphal arches and the Colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how Roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. We will also examine monuments on the edges of Rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern France and Romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between Romans and the peoples they conquered. Students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief Roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of Rome's military efforts, to subvert Rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to \"be Roman\" as wars transformed Rome from a small city in Italy to a massive, pan-Mediterranean empire. After exploring Romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the Roman Empire and modern America is appropriate.\nOffered asARTH\u00a0336,ARTH\u00a0436,CLSC\u00a0336andCLSC\u00a0436.

We will first study the concepts of the monsters and the monstrous in medieval Europe, as they were manifested in visual, literary, and cryptozoological production. From monster theory to monster culture, we will look at the anxieties that the monsters--those from the edges, those from within--have written on the body of medieval art. These same anxieties, rooted in the fear of difference, manifest themselves in the macabre art: the art of living death that predicated material universe of the late Middle Ages. We will explore the ghosts and the revenants, the living corpses and the nimble skeletons that populate medieval murals, manuscripts, and sculpture. All this is wrapped into the notion of the miraculous, both wondrous and dangerous at once. Here, the focus will be on female bodies, seen as monstrous, macabre, and miraculous at once.

The great art collections of the Renaissance began in much the same way as these playful assemblages. From cabinets of curiosities containing treasures from foreign lands, to paintings of nude women by Titian and Raphael, these early collections marked the beginning of the modern art museum. What do the hoarding tendencies of the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680), founder of the `Kircherianum--a museum filled with taxidermy animals and mechanical inventions--have in common with Ronald Lauder's recent and widely publicized purchase of a Gustav Klimt painting for $135 million? Famous American art collectors of the 19th & 20th centuries like Henry Clay Frick, Isabella Stewart Gardner, and Peggy Guggenheim opened these formerly private realms of display to the public, revealing the complex motives and politics inherent to the practice of art collection. This course will focus first on the conceptual issues that informed early modern collecting in\nthe western world, and subsequently the way that these ideas and modalities later inflected and shaped the history of modern collecting--particularly in the private sector in Europe and America.\nOffered as:ARTH\u00a0368andARTH\u00a0468.

Motivated by ethical as well as scholarly concerns, eco-criticism not only enacts a fundamental examination of nature as an ideological construct, but also seeks to investigate the complex interrelationship between humanity and the environment.  Concurrently, there has been a marked interest in studying the role of \"green issues\" in contemporary art, particularly in tracing the development of earth art or eco-art from the early 1970s to the present.  The goal of this seminar is to forge a link between these two emergent strands by tracing the complex relationship between art and the environment from the nineteenth-century to the present, seeking to thereby assess the capaciousness of eco-criticism as a methodological approach to art history.\nOffered asARTH\u00a0382,ARTH\u00a0482andESTD\u00a0382.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "One of the most momentous occurrences of the 20th and 21st Centuries has received surprisingly little attention:  the transformation in how nearly everything around us is designed and made.  Chairs, desks, pens, cars, stoves, refrigerators, printing presses, lighting fixtures, and children's toys all look very different than they did a century ago, and often are made through manufacturing process and out of materials that did not exist then.  The history of industrial design can be traced back to the 19th century, and to the writings of social reformers such as William Morris and the teachings of progressive art schools such as the Bauhaus, which introduced a machine-made look and many classic modern designs, such as the Wassily Chair by Marcel Breuer.  But the term industrial design was only coined in 1929, and modern industrial design, which brought together careful analysis of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, styling, branding and streamlining--really dates from that period through the creations of a group of pioneering, unheralded American geniuses, such as Raymond Lowie, Norman Bel Geddes, Henry Dreyfuss, Walter Dorwin Teague, Brooks Stevens, Russel Wright, Eliot Noyes, Viktor Schreckengost, and Harley Earl.  In broad strokes, this class will lay out a history of industrial design from its origins until today.  It will combine discussion of the work of historically significant figures, who established the basic framework of the field, with analysis of products being made today, by figures such as Dieter Rams, Jony Ive, and Philippe Starck.  The class will also include a tour of and introduction to the Industrial Design program of the Cleveland Institute of Art, established by the great industrial designer and artist Viktor Schreckengost in 1933.

The culture industries (along with many other sectors) have been forced to re-examine the viability and utility of their current models, and the assumptions these models are predicated upon. Art institutions are in the process of reconciling their complicated and often contradictory relationship with white, sexist, ableist, and classist ideology, in which they have tacitly perpetuated dominant structures and perspectives while rhetorically advocating for reform and radical change. In this course, we will explore this contemporary cultural moment and unravel the seismic changes that have brought uncertainty to the art world. We will speculate potential futures free of racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, and classism, and the role that art could play within those possible futures. And we will explore alternative conceptions of art with the potential to instigate those futures through a focus on social engagement, community, and radical inclusion.\nOffered asARTH\u00a0310,ARTH\u00a0410,ARTS\u00a0300, andARTS\u00a0400."

Produced in west-central Mexico, these astounding objects--which combine Roman subject matter with distinctly Indigenous motifs and techniques--speak to the visual consequences of Mexico's status as both a colonial possession of Spain, and as a vital bastion of artistic innovation. This course uses objects like this one as a point of departure to investigate the art of the Iberian world--a world that extended far beyond the European continent during the 16th-18th centuries. In this course we will focus on the nexus of transpacific and transatlantic trade that facilitated the production of objects like the batea. We will explore the ways that maps, illustrated travelogues, frescos, paintings and prints worked alongside decorative objects such as feathered headdresses, weapons, and carved ivory statuettes in order to interrogate the place of material culture in the formation of knowledge. Readings will be drawn from art history, anthropology, and sociology and will highlight decolonial methodologies for understanding racial representation and the history of collecting.

This course questions the strict divide between the categories of \"pagan\" and \"Christian\" in Rome in the imperial period and beyond. Through a close examination of the artistic and architectural record, students will come to understand that this dichotomy is a modern invention; for people living in the Roman Empire, religious identities were extraordinarily fluid. Indeed, traditional polytheistic religion and Christianity remained closely intertwined for centuries after Constantine \"Christianized\" the Empire. Moreover, religious pluralism had been a fundamental part of Roman culture since the founding of ancient Rome. We will survey a range of material culture, including public statuary, sarcophagi, silver hordes, and temples and churches. We will also examine sites such as the border city of Dura-Europos in Syria to explore how religious identities in the Roman Empire (including Judaism, early Christianity, and so-called mystery cults) intertwined even when Rome was still supposedly a \"pagan\" Empire. The course pays particular attention to the art and architecture produced under Constantine, whom people today often remember as Rome's first Christian emperor but who represents, in fact, a complex amalgam of polytheistic and monotheistic practices and identities. We will also explore how Christian art slowly but ultimately became the predominant visual culture in the Roman Empire. Finally, we will examine how Early Islamic art and architecture exploited the Greco-Roman visual tradition to the ends of this new religion.\nOffered asARTH\u00a0325,ARTH\u00a0425andCLSC\u00a0325.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "Few societies in history have been as militaristic as ancient Rome--or as proud of their warrior culture. This course examines the many ways that Romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 B.C.E. to the reign of Constantine (306-337 C.E.). Why did Romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape Romans' military values? What can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the Roman world? We will explore major public monuments in the city of Rome (including triumphal arches and the Colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how Roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. We will also examine monuments on the edges of Rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern France and Romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between Romans and the peoples they conquered. Students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief Roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of Rome's military efforts, to subvert Rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to \"be Roman\" as wars transformed Rome from a small city in Italy to a massive, pan-Mediterranean empire. After exploring Romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the Roman Empire and modern America is appropriate.\nOffered asARTH\u00a0336,ARTH\u00a0436,CLSC\u00a0336andCLSC\u00a0436.

We will first study the concepts of the monsters and the monstrous in medieval Europe, as they were manifested in visual, literary, and cryptozoological production. From monster theory to monster culture, we will look at the anxieties that the monsters--those from the edges, those from within--have written on the body of medieval art. These same anxieties, rooted in the fear of difference, manifest themselves in the macabre art: the art of living death that predicated material universe of the late Middle Ages. We will explore the ghosts and the revenants, the living corpses and the nimble skeletons that populate medieval murals, manuscripts, and sculpture. All this is wrapped into the notion of the miraculous, both wondrous and dangerous at once. Here, the focus will be on female bodies, seen as monstrous, macabre, and miraculous at once.

The great art collections of the Renaissance began in much the same way as these playful assemblages. From cabinets of curiosities containing treasures from foreign lands, to paintings of nude women by Titian and Raphael, these early collections marked the beginning of the modern art museum. What do the hoarding tendencies of the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680), founder of the `Kircherianum--a museum filled with taxidermy animals and mechanical inventions--have in common with Ronald Lauder's recent and widely publicized purchase of a Gustav Klimt painting for $135 million? Famous American art collectors of the 19th & 20th centuries like Henry Clay Frick, Isabella Stewart Gardner, and Peggy Guggenheim opened these formerly private realms of display to the public, revealing the complex motives and politics inherent to the practice of art collection. This course will focus first on the conceptual issues that informed early modern collecting in\nthe western world, and subsequently the way that these ideas and modalities later inflected and shaped the history of modern collecting--particularly in the private sector in Europe and America.\nOffered as:ARTH\u00a0368andARTH\u00a0468.

Concurrently, there has been a marked interest in studying the role of \"green issues\" in contemporary art, particularly in tracing the development of earth art or eco-art from the early 1970s to the present.  The goal of this seminar is to forge a link between these two emergent strands by tracing the complex relationship between art and the environment from the nineteenth-century to the present, seeking to thereby assess the capaciousness of eco-criticism as a methodological approach to art history.\nOffered asARTH\u00a0382,ARTH\u00a0482andESTD\u00a0382.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "One of the most momentous occurrences of the 20th and 21st Centuries has received surprisingly little attention:  the transformation in how nearly everything around us is designed and made.  Chairs, desks, pens, cars, stoves, refrigerators, printing presses, lighting fixtures, and children's toys all look very different than they did a century ago, and often are made through manufacturing process and out of materials that did not exist then.  The history of industrial design can be traced back to the 19th century, and to the writings of social reformers such as William Morris and the teachings of progressive art schools such as the Bauhaus, which introduced a machine-made look and many classic modern designs, such as the Wassily Chair by Marcel Breuer.  But the term industrial design was only coined in 1929, and modern industrial design, which brought together careful analysis of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, styling, branding and streamlining--really dates from that period through the creations of a group of pioneering, unheralded American geniuses, such as Raymond Lowie, Norman Bel Geddes, Henry Dreyfuss, Walter Dorwin Teague, Brooks Stevens, Russel Wright, Eliot Noyes, Viktor Schreckengost, and Harley Earl.  In broad strokes, this class will lay out a history of industrial design from its origins until today.  It will combine discussion of the work of historically significant figures, who established the basic framework of the field, with analysis of products being made today, by figures such as Dieter Rams, Jony Ive, and Philippe Starck.  The class will also include a tour of and introduction to the Industrial Design program of the Cleveland Institute of Art, established by the great industrial designer and artist Viktor Schreckengost in 1933.

The course will also investigate contemporary Asian art and visual culture focusing on its global turn from the late 1980s. Fueled by international geopolitical change, economic boom, and the impact of globalization, art in Asia or by Asian artists has gained a high level of international visibility and taken a central position in contemporary art exhibitions and art criticism.

Despite the huge investment and the fierce competition for gamers -- or perhaps because of it -- many mainstream commercial games are uninspired, lacking distinctive artistic styles, engaging narratives or original gameplay. In contrast, indie and art games are much smaller affairs. One person or a small team develops the idea, creates the assets and programs the game, often designing it for a niche audience. The best indie and art games provide uniquely engaging experiences for players. They are personal expressions: compelling, thought-provoking and beautiful. \nIn this course, students will work individually to create an original indie or art game using GameMaker Studio. Class discussions and demonstrations will help students build fluency in the conceptual frameworks, aesthetics and contemporary practices associated with indie and art games. Students will build skills in pixel art drawing and animation, \"chiptune\" audio composition, UI/UX design and programming. The course culminates in a completed game that is shared with the CWRU community in a custom arcade cabinet.

We will also challenge the stereotype of a monolithic and static East Asia and see to develop a critical understanding of the internal and external forces integrating and dividing this region. We will examine how international diplomatic, commercial, military, religious, and cultural relationships shaped the individual countries as well as their relationships with each other and the world. \n\nThe course sweeps over large regions of time and space. It aims to put the contemporary discussion of globalization into historical perspective by examining the long-lasting interactions of East Asian countries with each other and the rest of the world. These connections were economic, political, cultural, and psychological. Topics include: global silver and trade flows, warfare and military technology, imperial domination and revolutionary resistance, and the role of historical memory, as in Nanking or Hiroshima. Sources include historical documents, pictures, films, and memoirs.\n\nAs we move through the course material our goal is not to gain total knowledge of modern East Asia, nor of China, Japan, Korea nor Vietnam.  Rather, by the end of the term you should be able to identify some of the main organizing themes in modern East Asian history and develop a greater understanding of the construction and nature of historical knowledge itself.\nOffered asHSTY\u00a0132andASIA\u00a0132.

We will explore the major historical transformations (political, economic, social, and cultural) of the last imperial dynasty, the Qing (1644-1911), and develop an understanding of the major social, political, economic, and intellectual cultural forces shaping the formation of modern China.  Contrary to commonly-held ideas in both West and in China that traditional Chinese society was timeless or stagnant, historians now see dramatic and significant changes during this period--to the economy, to gender relations, to religion, and to many other aspects of life.  This course surveys the social, political, economic, and cultural history of this era, with emphasis on recent research.  The main goals of the course will be to acquaint students with the key changes and to show the interplay between economic, social, and cultural changes on the one hand and political developments on the other.

As a surgeon with more than forty years of experience in a major metropolitan hospital, Nuland admits to actively participating in this denial.  Modern medicine, he argues, influences how we as individuals and as a culture not only view but also experience death.  \"Modern dying,\" he contends, \"takes place in the modern hospital, where it can be hidden, cleansed of its organic blight, and finally packaged for modern burial.\"  This course uses literature, history, and personal and critical accounts related to death as points of reference for examining the role modern medicine has come to play in how we die.\nThe course requires out-of-class service learning, reading quizzes, papers, participation, and attendance.

Each session will have readings that relate to the theory of narrative (primarily from the Charon textbook but also from other sources in the Ethics and Humanities professional literature) and related health humanities.  Many of the sessions will also include the application of reflective practice/close reading.  Additional elements will be writing workshops and use of film and visual art as narrative.  The class will meet once weekly for a 3 hour session.  This class is open to graduate students in any humanities or healthcare field, and will be especially useful to those who intend to have a future career in which direct care of patients/clients is a part of their work."

In his book, How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter, Sherwin Nuland describes how we have turned increasingly to modern medicine as one more means of denying the reality of death.  As a surgeon with more than forty years of experience in a major metropolitan hospital, Nuland admits to actively participating in this denial.  Modern medicine, he argues, influences how we as individuals and as a culture not only view but also experience death.  \"Modern dying,\" he contends, \"takes place in the modern hospital, where it can be hidden, cleansed of its organic blight, and finally packaged for modern burial.\"  This course uses literature, history, and personal and critical accounts related to death as points of reference for examining the role modern medicine has come to play in how we die.\nThe course requires out-of-class service learning, reading quizzes, papers, participation, and attendance.

Yet clean experimental design and careful analysis let them ask and answer fundamental biological questions and develop better tools to use the next time around.  Though biology's toolbox now offers astonishing precision and power, the logic of biological experimentation hasn't changed.  In this course, we will study that underlying logic, and what it lets us do.  We will read key papers spanning the development of modern biology, from the most basic working-out of the Central Dogma to recent advances.  We will pay particular attention to how well the authors used the tools available, and how successfully they accounted for their shortcomings---if indeed they did.\nThe emphasis of the course will be on classroom discussion.  There are no exams.  Instead, you will (1) write brief responses to weekly prompts for understanding, (2) write an in-depth proposal for a molecular biology research project, and (3) present your proposal orally to the class.

Why are some of them similar and others divergent? How has evolution shaped ecological interactions, such as disease-host dynamics? The \"tree of life\" describes phylogenetic hypotheses for evolutionary history among species, and modern phylogenetic comparative methods allow us to incorporate the tree of life into statistical analyses. This course will introduce phylogenetic comparative methods, why they are needed to answer many biological questions, how they are conducted, and how they can be used to evaluate hypotheses. These methods can be used for any group of organisms, from humans and their diseases, to plants, animals, or fungi. These methods also can be used to address a broad suite of questions in biology, including biomedical, ecological, evolutionary, developmental, and neuromechanical questions. For example, issues of public health can be more deeply addressed using these tools.

    "description": "\"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\"  --  Dobzhansky\nBiologists have long been fascinated by the diversity of life. Why are there so many species? Why are some of them similar and others divergent? How has evolution shaped ecological interactions, such as disease-host dynamics? The \"tree of life\" describes phylogenetic hypotheses for evolutionary history among species, and modern phylogenetic comparative methods allow us to incorporate the tree of life into statistical analyses. This course will introduce phylogenetic comparative methods, why they are needed to answer many biological questions, how they are conducted, and how they can be used to evaluate hypotheses. These methods can be used for any group of organisms, from humans and their diseases, to plants, animals, or fungi. These methods also can be used to address a broad suite of questions in biology, including biomedical, ecological, evolutionary, developmental, and neuromechanical questions. For example, issues of public health can be more deeply addressed using these tools. Students may bring their own data sets, or may use existing data sets, and will develop an independent research project using these tools. Undergraduates will present a poster at a public poster fair, as part of the requirements for the SAGES capstone.

There is logic to how each animal model has found its place in the menagerie of accepted animal models. Certain animal models allow us to test particular hypotheses that may not be possible to address in other animals. Moreover, some animal models are more relevant than others to studying a particular human disease.  This seminar-based course will focus on animal models that either are effective at modeling human disease, approach relevant neurobiological questions, or play a role in translational medicine.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "Digital innovation is one of the most important strategic topics in today's business. As our society continues to move deeply into a digital economy and companies are able to use more powerful algorithms and models to analyze detailed digital trace data from users, responsible and ethical considerations are no longer after-thoughts but should be the strategic focus of any firm that is trying to innovate with digital technology. This is a project-based course where students learn the practice of responsible and ethical digital innovations using the latest digital tools.\nResponsible and ethical digital innovations (REDIs) require the blend of five core skill sets: (a) technical skills in emerging digital technology (such as artificial intelligence, mobile and wearable technology, crypto computing, cloud-based micro-service architecture, and the Internet of Things), (b) an ability to gain deeper insights on user needs through human-centered design thinking and translate them into a set of design features, (c) a robust understanding on technical, legal, and business dimensions of responsible and ethical digital innovations, (d) an ability to design an innovative business model and build a robust financial model, and (e) an ability to lead an agile team of diverse members for continuous service delivery. Each of these skills needs to be supported through a set of digital tools and frameworks that are specifically designed to support to support responsible and ethical digital innovation practices.\nAny responsible and ethical digital innovation projects must begin with deep user research with ethnographic research methods, a careful analysis of the current value network, legal and technical analyses of ethical requirements of the key features, an agile development process of prototypes and experimentations to build a minimally viable product (MVP), and financial modeling of the business model based on robust market research. It requires collaborations across user research, UX design, front-end development for mobile and web, back-end development, cloud architecture, and increasingly mechanical engineering.\nIn this course, students will have a unique learning opportunity to learn the actual contemporary digital innovation practice, working on real-world projects in a small agile multi-disciplinary team. The goal is to equip students with the necessary technical and managerial skills. The target audience is the students who want to become product strategists, product managers, product owners, agile scrum masters, UX designers, full-stack developers, or digital innovation consultants.\nAll projects are client funded and students are primarily responsible to meet the client's requirements within a semester. Students will be assigned to a multi-disciplinary team of 6-8 students (following Amazon's two-pizza rule). Students are expected to spend 2 - 3 hours per week in regular team meetings and workshops. In addition, each student is expected to work 3 - 5 hours either individually or in a small team to complete their individual tasks. Students are led by co-instructors including a faculty member who has domain expertise for the project and an industry coach who manage the agile project. The faculty will serve as the project executive. The coach will serve as the project manager initially with a student apprentice who will play a larger role in managing the project.\nStudents are expected to pick up necessary technical tools and resources, self-taught, and use it for the project. If necessary, xLab will provide technical support by connecting students to technical experts or online resources. In general, students have a basic understanding of the necessary technological frameworks so that they can learn specific tools that they are required to use for the project."

    "description": "It behooves today's business leaders to be well acquainted with blockchain technologies and AI, two seemingly disparate technologies that have the potential to fundamentally disrupt a wide range of businesses. The popularity of blockchain technologies has increased exponentially since the release of bitcoin in 2009. While bitcoins garnered a lot of attention during the initial days, the focus has shifted over time to the underlying technology: blockchain. This wildly innovative technology has made possible tasks that were hitherto deemed implausible: validate ownership in a digital asset, verify the true state of a transaction without relying on a costly intermediary etc. Accurate predictions and sound judgements are two critical ingredients of any decision making process. While the jury is still out on whether algorithms can make sound judgements, recent developments in a field called machine learning (and its sub-field, deep learning) have led to dramatic improvements in the accuracy of predictions made by these algorithms. Significantly, this gain in accuracy has been accompanied by a reduction in overall costs. These in turn have spurred the recent interest in AI. Organizations that have enabled AI at the enterprise level appear to be making more informed decisions and innovating new products. In this course, we will unpack these technologies and examine a wide range of relevant business use cases. Our objective is to provide a practical introduction to these key technologies and their business implications. We focus on business perspectives, rather than on the technical dimensions. Fittingly, this course is open to all graduate students of Weatherhead School (MBA and all specialty Masters). Students are not expected to have any specific programming background; however, a basic understanding of statistics is required to better appreciate the discourse on Artificial Intelligence. \nOffered asBTEC\u00a0493,FNCE\u00a0493andFTEC\u00a0493.\nPrereq or Coreq:MBAC\u00a0504orMBAP\u00a0405."

This course begins with an introduction of Machine Learning models; various key ideas such as bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation, regularization techniques are introduced with relevant examples from Finance. The course then proceeds to discuss Artificial Neural Networks and its relevance to Deep Learning. Foundational ideas such as back-propagation are discussed in sufficient detail; we also lay a lot of emphasis on evaluating the performance of all these models. A key objective of this course is help students build cutting-edge A.I. models that are ready for prime time, i.e., real-life applications. Fittingly, we work with several real-life datasets and case studies from banking and finance. We will work with three case studies, each of which span multiple sessions. -In the first case study, students use Machine Learning algorithms to understand how imbalanced datasets are handled in real-life. -In the second study, students use time series data and learn not only about the power of regularization techniques but also to highlight the prominence of A.I. in financial markets. -In the third case study, students learn how to use cutting-edge Deep Learning models to extract sentiments from disparate news sources; these are in turn used to generate trading strategies. By contrasting the effort that goes into and the payoff obtained from Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, students gain an intuitive appreciation of both these classes of models.\nOffered asBTEC\u00a0494,FNCE\u00a0494andFTEC\u00a0494."

As we read the plays, we pay close attention to the historical context and look for what each play can tell us about myth, religion, ethics, and society in ancient Athens. Finally, we give attention to the way these tragic dramas and the theater in which they were performed have continued to inspire literature and theater for thousands of years. Lectures provide historical background on the playwrights, the plays, the mythic and historical background, and possible interpretation of the texts as literature and as performance pieces.

Students in Theater in Ancient Rome will read a significant number of ancient Roman plays in modern English translation and study non-literary theatrical entertainment of the Roman Republic and Empire, that may include mime and pantomime, gladiatorial shows, political speeches, courtroom drama, and various other spectacles. The dramatic texts that we shall study include the fragments of early Latin drama, selected comedies by Plautus and Terence, and the tragedies of Seneca. We shall also consider Greek and Roman literature that comments on Roman theatrical practices. These works will be read for their literary merits and theatrical possibilities, while at the same time examining them for what they can tell us about Roman civilization. Similarly, when studying the non-literary theatrical works we shall examine historical and theatrical context including archaeological evidence from theaters and amphitheaters and material remains (masks, depictions of actors and gladiators on vases, terra cotta lamps, mosaics, etc.). Finally, while the majority of the course focuses on drama originally written in Latin and theatrical entertainments performed in ancient Rome, the course may include a brief survey of selected post-classical works indebted to the tradition of Roman drama and theater. Authors that may be studied include Hrotsvitha, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, and the legacy of Roman drama and theater in contemporary stage and cinema such as Sondheim's A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.

    "description": "People often single out the reign of Constantine (A.D. 306-337) as the point in history when Rome transformed from a polytheistic empire to a Christian empire. This course questions the strict divide between the categories of \"pagan\" and \"Christian\" in Rome in the imperial period and beyond. Through a close examination of the artistic and architectural record, students will come to understand that this dichotomy is a modern invention; for people living in the Roman Empire, religious identities were extraordinarily fluid. Indeed, traditional polytheistic religion and Christianity remained closely intertwined for centuries after Constantine \"Christianized\" the Empire. Moreover, religious pluralism had been a fundamental part of Roman culture since the founding of ancient Rome. We will survey a range of material culture, including public statuary, sarcophagi, silver hordes, and temples and churches. We will also examine sites such as the border city of Dura-Europos in Syria to explore how religious identities in the Roman Empire (including Judaism, early Christianity, and so-called mystery cults) intertwined even when Rome was still supposedly a \"pagan\" Empire. The course pays particular attention to the art and architecture produced under Constantine, whom people today often remember as Rome's first Christian emperor but who represents, in fact, a complex amalgam of polytheistic and monotheistic practices and identities. We will also explore how Christian art slowly but ultimately became the predominant visual culture in the Roman Empire. Finally, we will examine how Early Islamic art and architecture exploited the Greco-Roman visual tradition to the ends of this new religion.\nOffered asARTH\u00a0325,ARTH\u00a0425andCLSC\u00a0325.

We will also explore important sites outside of the city, including Rome's remarkably well-preserved port at Ostia, the Emperor Hadrian's magnificent villa at Tivoli, and an optional visit to Pompeii and Herculaneum during an extended weekend.\nSome of the questions we will be asking when visiting the sites include: How did the expansion of the Roman Empire influence the stylistic repertories of the capital's artists and architects? How did the changing political environment shape the topography of the city from Republic to Empire? How can we read political messages and propaganda in the ancient structures? How did (and does) Rome live among, use, and reuse ancient remains?\nStudents will be expected to be active participants in the daily tours. All students will be presenting on various structures as we come to them (topics to be assigned in advance of the trip). Graduate students are responsible for leading a day tour (with my assistance) - to create the itinerary and develop the thematic framework. Grades will be based on participation on site, presentations, and a paper.  \nOffered asCLSC\u00a0326andCLSC\u00a0426. Counts as a CAS Global & Cultural Diversity course."

This course examines the many ways that Romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 B.C.E. to the reign of Constantine (306-337 C.E.). Why did Romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape Romans' military values? What can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the Roman world? We will explore major public monuments in the city of Rome (including triumphal arches and the Colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how Roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. We will also examine monuments on the edges of Rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern France and Romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between Romans and the peoples they conquered. Students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief Roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of Rome's military efforts, to subvert Rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to \"be Roman\" as wars transformed Rome from a small city in Italy to a massive, pan-Mediterranean empire. After exploring Romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the Roman Empire and modern America is appropriate.\nOffered asARTH\u00a0336,ARTH\u00a0436,CLSC\u00a0336andCLSC\u00a0436.

As we read the plays, we pay close attention to the historical context and look for what each play can tell us about myth, religion, ethics, and society in ancient Athens. Finally, we give attention to the way these tragic dramas and the theater in which they were performed have continued to inspire literature and theater for thousands of years. Lectures provide historical background on the playwrights, the plays, the mythic and historical background, and possible interpretation of the texts as literature and as performance pieces. Students discuss the plays that they read in class.

Students in Theater in Ancient Rome will read a significant number of ancient Roman plays in modern English translation and study non-literary theatrical entertainment of the Roman Republic and Empire, that may include mime and pantomime, gladiatorial shows, political speeches, courtroom drama, and various other spectacles. The dramatic texts that we shall study include the fragments of early Latin drama, selected comedies by Plautus and Terence, and the tragedies of Seneca. We shall also consider Greek and Roman literature that comments on Roman theatrical practices. These works will be read for their literary merits and theatrical possibilities, while at the same time examining them for what they can tell us about Roman civilization. Similarly, when studying the non-literary theatrical works we shall examine historical and theatrical context including archaeological evidence from theaters and amphitheaters and material remains (masks, depictions of actors and gladiators on vases, terra cotta lamps, mosaics, etc.). Finally, while the majority of the course focuses on drama originally written in Latin and theatrical entertainments performed in ancient Rome, the course may include a brief survey of selected post-classical works indebted to the tradition of Roman drama and theater. Authors that may be studied include Hrotsvitha, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, and the legacy of Roman drama and theater in contemporary stage and cinema such as Sondheim's A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Thus a secondary concern will be to consider how and in what ways the legacy of Roman drama and theater has continued to shape the dramatic arts since antiquity. \nOffered asCLSC\u00a0322,CLSC\u00a0422,THTR\u00a0322,THTR\u00a0422,WLIT\u00a0322, andWLIT\u00a0422.

Is ethics primarily informed by nature or by culture?  Or is ethics informed by both?  This course examines 1) ways in which cognitive science--and related fields such as evolutionary biology--impact traditional moral perspectives, and 2) how the study of moral philosophy and comparative ethics forces reconsideration of broad cognitive science theories about the nature of ethics.  The course examines the concept of free will as a case study in applying these interpretive viewpoints.

In recent years, the role of culture and cultural diversity has come to play a significant role in thinking about social cognition and the evolution of sociality. It is likewise an unfortunate fact that many human beings lack many of the means, abilities, and dispositions to connect with one another easily and without extensive and explicit tutelage. Such clinical populations (e.g., autistics, schizophrenics, etc.) are of considerable interest because of their promise as a contrastive model of typicality.\nThis course will focus on these aspects of sociality both at the level of the interpersonal and personal (cognitive and phenomenological) and the sub-personal (neuronscientific).\nBy term's end, students in this class will develop a deep understanding of several dimensions of social cognition research and its implications for the next generation of cognitive neuroscience.

Dialogue topics included issues related to Buddhist thought and practice, and cognitive science. Others with an interest in the intersection of Buddhism and cognitive science, such as Robert Wright in Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment (2017), argue that non-supernatural aspects of Buddhism, such as the benefits of mindfulness meditation and the nature of the (non-)self, are affirmed by cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. The notion that at least some aspects of Buddhism are \"true\" in relation to contemporary cognitive scientific views of mind and brain has attracted considerable attention from both Buddhist practitioners and cognitive scientists.\nThis seminar explores Buddhist and cognitive science perspectives on issues such as embodied cognition, consciousness, mind, self and personal identity, theory of mind, morality, representation, and language. We start with a general overview of Buddhist philosophy, and then turn to specific readings on Buddhist concepts in relation to similar concepts found in the cognitive science literature. For instance, we will explore the Buddhist concept of no permanent self or soul (an-tman). This idea resonates with Daniel Dennett's notion of the \"narrative self\" and the cognitive neuroscience view that there is no neurological center of self or experience.\nAlthough the specific concepts covered will vary in each iteration of this course, readings will always be drawn from both Buddhist primary and secondary readings, and from the cognitive science literature.\nOffered asCOGS\u00a0348,COGS\u00a0448,RLGN\u00a0348andRLGN\u00a0448.

In recent years, the role of culture and cultural diversity has come to play a significant role in thinking about social cognition and the evolution of sociality. It is likewise an unfortunate fact that many human beings lack many of the means, abilities, and dispositions to connect with one another easily and without extensive and explicit tutelage. Such clinical populations (e.g., autistics, schizophrenics, etc.) are of considerable interest because of their promise as a contrastive model of typicality.\nThis course will focus on these aspects of sociality both at the level of the interpersonal and personal (cognitive and phenomenological) and the sub-personal (neuronscientific).\nBy term's end, students in this class will develop a deep understanding of several dimensions of social cognition research and its implications for the next generation of cognitive neuroscience.

Important factors in second language learning will be identified and discussed. These include: age-related differences, the influence of the first language, the role played by innate (universal) principles, the role of memory processes, attitudes, motivation, personality and cognitive styles, and formal versus naturalistic learning contexts.

Dialogue topics included issues related to Buddhist thought and practice, and cognitive science. Others with an interest in the intersection of Buddhism and cognitive science, such as Robert Wright in Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment (2017), argue that non-supernatural aspects of Buddhism, such as the benefits of mindfulness meditation and the nature of the (non-)self, are affirmed by cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. The notion that at least some aspects of Buddhism are \"true\" in relation to contemporary cognitive scientific views of mind and brain has attracted considerable attention from both Buddhist practitioners and cognitive scientists.\nThis seminar explores Buddhist and cognitive science perspectives on issues such as embodied cognition, consciousness, mind, self and personal identity, theory of mind, morality, representation, and language. We start with a general overview of Buddhist philosophy, and then turn to specific readings on Buddhist concepts in relation to similar concepts found in the cognitive science literature. For instance, we will explore the Buddhist concept of no permanent self or soul (an-tman). This idea resonates with Daniel Dennett's notion of the \"narrative self\" and the cognitive neuroscience view that there is no neurological center of self or experience.\nAlthough the specific concepts covered will vary in each iteration of this course, readings will always be drawn from both Buddhist primary and secondary readings, and from the cognitive science literature.\nOffered asCOGS\u00a0348,COGS\u00a0448,RLGN\u00a0348andRLGN\u00a0448.

    "description": "This course introduces key concepts and techniques for characterizing, from observational or experimental study data and from background information, the causal effect of a specific treatment, exposure, or intervention (e.g., a medical treatment) upon an outcome of interest (e.g., disease status). The fundamental problem of causal inference is the impossibility of observing the effects of different and incompatible treatments on the same individual or unit.  This problem is overcome by estimating an average causal effect over a study population.  Making valid causal inferences with observational data is especially challenging, because of the greater potential for biases (confounding bias, selection bias, and measurement bias) that can badly distort causal effect estimates.  Consequently, this topic has been the focus of intense cross-disciplinary research in recent years.  Causal inference techniques will be illustrated by applications in several fields such as computer science, engineering, medicine, public health, biology, genomics, neuroscience, economics, and social science.  Course grading will be based on quizzes, homeworks, a class presentation, and a causal data analysis project.\n\nSpecific topics: treatments, exposures, and interventions; causal effects and causal effect measures; confounding bias; potential outcomes and counterfactuals; randomized experiments; observational studies; causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); exchangeability and conditional exchangeability; effect modification; causal interactions; nonparametric structural equations; Pearl's Back-Door Criterion, Front-Door Criterion, and related results; covariate adjustment; matching on covariates; selection bias; measurement bias; instrumental variables; causal modeling; inverse probability weighting; marginal structural models; standardization; structural nested models; outcome regression; propensity scores; sensitivity analysis.\nPrereq:CSDS\u00a0440orMATH\u00a0380orSTAT\u00a0312orSTAT\u00a0313orSTAT\u00a0332orSTAT\u00a0333or Requisites Not Met permission."

Innovative business models focus on a set of customer attributes that are usually very different from other industry incumbents that we call Focal Attributes. Your second challenge is to clearly state your profit logic -- how you will make money -- how to win.  The concept called Profit Objectives (similar but not the same as KPI and/or SMART objectives) allow you to operationalize the profit logic through specific and measurable deliverables.   Your third challenge is building the value chain that can deliver these focal attributes (what to do).  At this point, you have a good understanding of all the elements of your business model and in particular, how the focal attributes and the value chain align with the profit objectives.

Powered by increasingly smaller yet potent microprocessors and sensors, a new generation of analytical tools, and ubiquitous wearable and mobile devices, companies can radically transform the way they interact with users and the way they create and capture value. Technology like Block Chain and AI are likely to fundamentally reshape how we think about firms and industries. Such changes make existing strategic frameworks and tools obsolete. In order to understand how and why digital technology changes the industrial landscape, companies must understand some of the fundamental characteristics of digital technology and how it demands new types of value creation logic. \n\nBe it a large corporation or a small start-up; or a government agency or a multinational enterprise; everyone is struggling to deal with the new digital reality. Yet, exactly how to use digital technology to create value is not clear. While all companies must understand how digital technology is fundamentally different from other forms of technology, ironically digital innovation is not about technology. Digital innovation is making digital technology meaningful and value to users. Therefore, digital innovation requires us to truly understand us (people), what we do, why we do what we do, what makes us happy, and what we consider meaningful. Therefore, digital innovation is a deeply humanistic exploration to make digital technology meaningful and valuable to us. \n\nIn order to fully harness the transformative capacity of digital technology, we must gain deeper insights on people and their actions, meanings and values. In this experiential course, we use design as the primary tool to gain such humanistic insights, and work with real-world projects to apply those ideas and tools to build real digital innovations."

We look at problems faced by real organizations, examining questions such as, are Facebook and Uber fundamentally new types of firms? Why do some firms offer high-paying jobs while competitors in the same industry do not (eg, Costco vs. Wal-mart)?  What are the impacts of different kinds of contracts with workers and supply chain firms on incentives to work hard, invest, and innovate? Should firms maximize shareholder value, or something else? Why are firms often not able to survive \"disruptive innovation\"? Are venture capitalists promoters or thwarters of innovation?

Over the past four decades, the incarceration rate in the United States has grown to an historically unprecedented level with approximately 2.2 million people behind bars. In light of the substantial resources allocated towards crime, it is only natural to ask whether the criminal justice system achieves its goals. The purpose of this course is to develop the analytical skills necessary for understanding the economic rational for criminal law and the criminal justice system. Through the lens of microeconomic theory, we will deal with questions such as when and what to criminalize, the severity of punishment, the determinants of the supply of criminal activity, the effects of policing, and the optimal level of enforcement. This course will introduce students to key concepts in crime policy and help develop their policy analysis skills, including the ability to frame problems and policy alternatives, think critically about empirical evidence, use cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis to compare policy alternatives, and communicate the findings in writing.\nPrereq:ECON\u00a0102."

While the popularity of sports is unquestioned, there are many ways in which economics can delve more deeply into the hidden inner-workings of the sports world. When sports teams acquire a new player, are they attempting to maximize wins, or profits? Do the NCAA, NFL, or other sports leagues have a monopoly, and what costs would this entail? What incentives guide sports teams, strategies, and would they ever lose on purpose? Is it worth it to subsidize a sports team to build a new stadium, or renovate an existing arena, in your city? The purpose of this course is to perform economic analysis of sports teams, leagues, and institutions by applying economic tools to a variety of sport-related topics. Microeconomic theory is applied to these questions, and others, drawing from economic fields including industrial organization and public finance. Students with an interest in applying basic economic tools to answer real-world questions in the rapidly growing world of sports should strongly consider taking this course.\nPrereq:ECON\u00a0102."

The rapid growth in healthcare spending has accompanied growing concerns about the quality and efficiency of U.S. healthcare delivery and persistent disparities in access to care. Are these concerns justified? If so, what can policymakers do - and what are they doing - to address them? The purpose of this course is to develop the analytical skills necessary for understanding how the U.S. health care sector operates, how it has evolved, the forces at work behind perceived deficiencies (in access, quality and cost control), and the expected impact of alternative policy proposals. These issues are addressed through the lens of microeconomic theory. Under this framework, outcomes result from the interaction of decisions made by participants in the healthcare economy (e.g. patients, providers, insurers, government), with those decisions governed by the preferences, incentives and resource constraints facing each decision-maker. This course should be of particular interest to students who envision future careers in healthcare delivery, healthcare management, pharmaceutical and device innovation, health insurance or public health, as well as other policy-oriented students seeking to understand the contentious issues in healthcare policymaking.\nPrereq:ECON\u00a0102."

Negotiations occur everywhere: in marriages, in divorces, in small work teams, in large organizations, in getting a job, in losing a job, in deal making, in decision making, in board rooms, and in court rooms. The remarkable thing about negotiations is that, wherever they occur, they are governed by similar principles. The current wave of corporate restructuring makes the study of negotiations especially important for M.B.A.s. Mergers, acquisitions, downsizing and joint ventures call into question well established business and employment relationships.

The goal of this course is to address issues relating to the commercialization of biomedical-related inventions by exposing law students, MBA students, and Ph.D. candidates (in genetics and proteomics) to the challenges and opportunities encountered when attempting to develop biomedical intellectual property from the point of early discovery to the clinic and market.  Specifically, this course seeks to provide students with the ability to value a given technological advance or invention holistically, focusing on issues that extend beyond scientific efficacy and include patient and practitioner value propositions, legal and intellectual property protection, business modeling, potential market impacts, market competition, and ethical, social, and healthcare practitioner acceptance.  During this course, law students, MBA students, and Ph.D. candidates in genomics and proteomics will work in teams of five (two laws students, two MBA students and one Ph.D. candidate), focusing on issues of commercialization and IP management of biomedical-related inventions.  The instructors will be drawn from the law school, business school, and technology-transfer office.

From generative language models to video surveillance and identity detection to facial recognition, AI is becoming more and more embedded in our everyday lives. These AI technologies are increasingly built on our data, whether we are aware of it or not. In this praxis-oriented course, we will explore how data is fundamental to the development of AI technologies and develop practices for increased awareness of and participation in this data ecosystem. As we interrogate AI systems in everyday life through hands-on engagement with AI tools and their data pipelines, we will begin to construct a data citizenship model that can help us reclaim the power of collective responsibility in order to build a more just and sustainable socio-technical future. Students will focus their individual and group projects on questions and issues directly related to the subject area of the offering they are enrolled in.\nOffered asCOGS\u00a0250,ENGL\u00a0250,HUMN\u00a0250,MUGN\u00a0250,PHIL\u00a0250andRLGN\u00a0250.

    "description": "The health of a democratic society depends on an informed electorate. And yet the attack ads, unverified accusations, sound-bites, and carefully scripted and staged media events that fill television and the Internet tend to misinform, confuse, and disengage voters. How might we reverse this trend? How can we meaningfully enter into political conversations? How can we listen to others, form our own beliefs, and then communicate them respectfully and with purpose?  \nTo help answer these questions, we will return to modern democracy's ancient roots, using the lens of classical rhetoric to explore contemporary political debate. While the word \"rhetoric\" is often used today to deride precisely what's wrong with political discourse, as when a policy proposal is dismissed as mere \"campaign rhetoric,\" it more properly denotes the techniques of effective persuasion. By learning how rhetorical devices are used, we can empower ourselves to analyze policy debates and to make our own contributions.  \nAs part of this investigation, we will research issues, debate and develop positions, read and evaluate speeches, write and speak about our own positions, participate in public debates by writing letters to representatives and opinion pieces for newspapers. We will also experiment with various presentation styles and occasions to build our persuasive speaking skills. In our final project, we will research, analyze, and share our perspectives on an issue of interest, and reflect on our internal processes as we take on a belief and act on it.

These are some questions taken up by the authors we are reading in this course -- and the answers to which require a complex consideration of one's social position in terms of gender, race, social class, sexual identity, and ability. In this communication-intensive course, we will examine how literary authors engage with the politics of beauty and appearance in their works in order to call attention to important issues of equality and access to opportunity. We will read the works of poets, short story writers, and novelists, alongside those of cultural critics, philosophers, and filmmakers who call attention to the specifically-political nature of body size, hair, skin tone, modes of dress, and other body issues. Our ultimate goal is to uncover and analyze the complex, intersectional power relations involved in past and present beauty standards.

You have identified a group of customers for your product or service (where to play).  Your first challenge is to know what features (Customer Attributes) your target customer will pay for. Innovative business models focus on a set of customer attributes that are usually very different from other industry incumbents that we call Focal Attributes. Your second challenge is to clearly state your profit logic -- how you will make money -- how to win.  The concept called Profit Objectives (similar but not the same as KPI and/or SMART objectives) allow you to operationalize the profit logic through specific and measurable deliverables.   Your third challenge is building the value chain that can deliver these focal attributes (what to do).  At this point, you have a good understanding of all the elements of your business model and in particular, how the focal attributes and the value chain align with the profit objectives. You will learn how to illustrate this alignment through a mapping process.\nOffered asDESN\u00a0308andENTP\u00a0308.\nPrereq: Junior standing or higher."

Concurrently, there has been a marked interest in studying the role of \"green issues\" in contemporary art, particularly in tracing the development of earth art or eco-art from the early 1970s to the present.  The goal of this seminar is to forge a link between these two emergent strands by tracing the complex relationship between art and the environment from the nineteenth-century to the present, seeking to thereby assess the capaciousness of eco-criticism as a methodological approach to art history.\nOffered asARTH\u00a0382,ARTH\u00a0482andESTD\u00a0382.

In addition to exploring their Jewishness vis-\u00e0-vis others, we also examine questions of exclusion and belonging that Jews have faced as they have encountered each another in recent decades through tourism, mass migration, globalization, and the internet.

African feminist theory of scholars such as Filomina Steady, Cheikh Anta Diop, Buchi Emecheta, Ifi Amadiume, Obioma Nnameka, Oyeronko Oyewumi, and Calixthe Beyala will be studied and there will be some comparative analysis of Western theories to show how African feminisms are clearly distinct. Theories on these feminisms will be presented, and in the process, students will look at cases of women in Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal.  It is commonly believed that African women were defined for a long time according to constructs of Western anthropology.  This course will thus look at social institutions such as woman-to-woman marriage, matriarchy, and various women's rituals in order to identify African constructs of gender, family, kinship, marriage, and motherhood.\nOffered asETHS\u00a0352andWGST\u00a0352.

This is a relatively low risk strategy.  We will develop methodologies that will allow you to identify markets (segments) where your current capabilities are leveragable.\n-Shaping a market usually requires developing a completely new set of capabilities - very risky.  We will develop concepts to understand techniques to mitigate these risks.\n-Acquisitions as one of the means for corporate development\n-Approximately half of the class sessions will be devoted to the specific case of acquisitions as a means to expand the boundaries of a firm.

    "description": "The course seeks to help corporate managers understand how financial design can be used to advance the goals and strategies of the firm.  In the Finance course, you concentrated almost exclusively on the firm's capital expenditure decision.  You studied in great detail the discounted cash flow model, NPV, how you get your cash flows, and how you discount according to risk.  Now we move to the other side of the balance sheet to look at how the firm can finance these expenditures.  The first part of this class provides the basic building blocks of financial engineering which begins with call and put options.  The course focuses on using derivatives (calls and puts) to change a firm's risk profile with respect to equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity risks.  We look at capital structure decisions and securitization issues and discuss what it means to create optimal structures.  Almost immediately we will tie this to our financial crisis and obtain an appreciation for financial designs that could be setup so as to enhance firm value, mitigate systemic risks, or accomplish specific sustainable goals in a global economy.  The second part of the class is geared towards real options and its relationship to strategic planning. In competitive markets, no one expects to formulate a detailed long-term plan and follow it mindlessly.  As soon as we start down the path, we begin learning about business conditions, competitors' actions, and so forth and we need to respond flexibly to what we learn.  Unfortunately, the financial tool most widely relied on to estimate the value of strategy, DCF, assumes that we follow a predetermined plan, regardless of how events unfold.  A better approach to valuation would incorporate both the uncertainty inherent in business and the active decision making required for strategy to succeed.\nPrereq: E.M.B.A. candidates only."

In this course you will learn a systematic but iterative process to do this.  We will expose you to some broad categories of business models and internalize the basic logic of how to make money in each of these categories.  The first step is to recognize which of these categories is most applicable to your business.  The second step is to customize these broad patterns to the specifics of the business at hand.  This seems easy because everything is in English and there are no hard formulas to figure out.  However, unless you discipline yourself to systematically go through a structured process (there are other equally valid processes than the ones you'll be exposed to) it is very easy to fall into the ad hoc trap.\n\nYou will internalize this process by applying it over a wide range of business situations that will give you confidence in its applicability to any business opportunity.

    "description": "It behooves today's business leaders to be well acquainted with blockchain technologies and AI, two seemingly disparate technologies that have the potential to fundamentally disrupt a wide range of businesses. The popularity of blockchain technologies has increased exponentially since the release of bitcoin in 2009. While bitcoins garnered a lot of attention during the initial days, the focus has shifted over time to the underlying technology: blockchain. This wildly innovative technology has made possible tasks that were hitherto deemed implausible: validate ownership in a digital asset, verify the true state of a transaction without relying on a costly intermediary etc. Accurate predictions and sound judgements are two critical ingredients of any decision making process. While the jury is still out on whether algorithms can make sound judgements, recent developments in a field called machine learning (and its sub-field, deep learning) have led to dramatic improvements in the accuracy of predictions made by these algorithms. Significantly, this gain in accuracy has been accompanied by a reduction in overall costs. These in turn have spurred the recent interest in AI. Organizations that have enabled AI at the enterprise level appear to be making more informed decisions and innovating new products. In this course, we will unpack these technologies and examine a wide range of relevant business use cases. Our objective is to provide a practical introduction to these key technologies and their business implications. We focus on business perspectives, rather than on the technical dimensions. Fittingly, this course is open to all graduate students of Weatherhead School (MBA and all specialty Masters). Students are not expected to have any specific programming background; however, a basic understanding of statistics is required to better appreciate the discourse on Artificial Intelligence. \nOffered asBTEC\u00a0493,FNCE\u00a0493andFTEC\u00a0493.\nPrereq: For Master of Finance students only."

Therefore, an understanding of processes like swallowing and salivation are central to the practice of dentistry, while a basic understanding of digestive function is central to the continued well-being of the patient because it is the portal for entry of nutrients to the body. Disorders associated with the digestive tract, or which impact the function of the digestive tract (for instance, bulimia) can have profound effects on oral health, while some pharmacological agents used in the treatment of those disorders have potential adverse effects on oral health. Therefore, a firm understanding of the gastrointestinal tract in health and disease is a necessity for modern dental care."

    "description": "One of the major connective tissues of the human body is blood. The kidneys play a role in the filtration of the plasma and assist in the maintenance of blood pressure and acid-base balance. The cellular entities of the blood (red cells, white cells and platelets) are needed to provide flow of oxygen and other metabolic substrates to and from all the tissues of the body and play a significant role in the defense of the body and repair of these tissues. It is therefore necessary for the dental practitioner to understand the histology, anatomy, physiology and pathologic processes that affect these systems."

    "description": "Designing is giving form to an idea for a more desirable product, service, process or organization, and refining the idea into something that can be delivered reliably and efficiently. Good design integrates these evolving ideas with the day-to-day realities of a firms' operations, systems, marketing, economics, finance and human resources. Designing is thus a unique managerial activity that brings together changing technologies, capabilities, relationships, activities and materials to shape an organization's plans and strategies. It combines analysis and synthesis to create opportunities for improvement and means of attaining them. Viewed this way, designing is a core competence of a successful entrepreneur or innovative leader. Design analysis is the systematic review of the four orders of design found in every firm--namely, the firm's communications, products, interactions and environments--and the creation of opportunities to increase firm value by improving each. Students will identify ill-defined, ill-structured problems within organizations. Such problems are ones for which there are no definitive formulations and for which the formulation chosen affects the solutions available. For such problems, there is no explicit way of knowing when you have reached a solution, and solutions cannot necessarily be considered correct or incorrect. But finding innovative solutions to such problems can provide unique opportunities to create exceptional value. A major outcome of the semester's inquiry is a presentation of the design problem and proposed design solution.\nPrereq: Master of Healthcare Management students only."

We will also challenge the stereotype of a monolithic and static East Asia and see to develop a critical understanding of the internal and external forces integrating and dividing this region. We will examine how international diplomatic, commercial, military, religious, and cultural relationships shaped the individual countries as well as their relationships with each other and the world. \n\nThe course sweeps over large regions of time and space. It aims to put the contemporary discussion of globalization into historical perspective by examining the long-lasting interactions of East Asian countries with each other and the rest of the world. These connections were economic, political, cultural, and psychological. Topics include: global silver and trade flows, warfare and military technology, imperial domination and revolutionary resistance, and the role of historical memory, as in Nanking or Hiroshima.

    "description": "A utopia is a dream of a better world; a dystopia is a nightmare of a worse one. Both are fantasies. Yet both respond to the very real technological, political and cultural conditions in which they are written. This multidisciplinary course uses utopian and dystopian literature from the sixteenth century to the present to investigate the rise of scientific modernity and the responses it provoked. Starting with Thomas More's Utopia, and ending with Octavia Butler's The Parable of the Sower and a contemporary film, students will read important utopian and dystopian works of fiction and connect them to themes that run through the history of science: the relationship between knowledge and power; the impact of new technologies; voyages of exploration and exploitation; industrialization and forms of production; ideas of gender, race, and class; nuclear power; genetics; and climate change. We encourage students to ask what led to these specific critiques or ideas, and why? What limits or determines the boundaries of the possible or the desirable to each author? And how might these still be relevant today?\nOffered asENGL\u00a0145andHSTY\u00a0145. Counts as a CAS Global & Cultural Diversity course."

Britain was a nation of great technological, economic, and military power, but it also experienced extraordinary stresses.  Industrialization meant material prosperity for some, but hardship and dehumanization for others.  Many questioned how overwhelming poverty and ignorance could be allowed to stand beside such vast affluence.  And subjects of the British in India, Ireland, and elsewhere struggled for independence from an empire that claimed to bring freedom, reason, and equality.  The British learned to their cost, too, that decolonization often meant being caught in the crossfire of ethnic rivals.

It begins with some background coverage of the colonial period (1607-1763), but focuses primarily on the underlying causes of the American Revolution, the chain of events leading to the Declaration of Independence, the war with England, postwar conflicts of the 1780s, the Constitutional Convention, and the ratification struggle that followed, with a look forward to the so-called Whiskey Rebellion of 1794. Lectures, readings, and discussions explore the Revolutionary crisis as a complex, multi-racial, transatlantic struggle involving Native Americans, African Americans (enslaved and free), poor whites, wealthy Anglo-American planters and merchants, Scottish traders, and British administrators, as well as multi-racial and multi-national military forces organized on radically opposing principles. The course also examines competing scholarly interpretations of the Revolution as a progressive or retrograde watershed in American gender relations. Finally, it considers competing interpretations of the aftermath of the Revolution during the 1780s and thereafter as representing either an acceleration of \"radical\" social change or a conservative \"counterrevolution\"--with corresponding implications for the lower classes and for other historically disempowered social groups.

What counts as expertise, and what counts as evidence when it comes to deciding a case that hinges on questions of science? Are legal facts ever different from scientific facts?

This course will chart the history and impact of corporate capitalism. Topics will include the corporation's impact on democracy, consumer culture, the environment, and even the university itself. If you have ever wondered why products are purposely designed to wear out (planned obsolescence), why unions are so powerless in America, why the military is as powerful as it is, why it takes special technology from the Diebold corporation to run a simple election, why broadcasting companies are allowed to profit by using the public airwaves for free, why it looks like there are a million publishers of books when in truth giant companies dominate 80 percent of the book market, why the perfect lawn is a marketing ploy to get consumers to buy a lot of chemical inputs, why universities, which are supposed to be bastions of independent thought, are now dominated by an army of administrators who run around talking about return on investment instead of figuring out how to create a culture where students can learn, then this is the course for you.

This course is an invitation to focus on primary sources and wrestle with the writing of colonial history throughout the last 500 years, with all its discrepancies, biases, and unanswered questions.  We look especially at the role that women, Indigenous peoples, and Africans played in society--voices that have traditionally been silenced. How can we resurrect those voices?

Over the last millennium, France has viewed Saracens, Moriscos, Turks, Berbers, and Arabs with admiration and fear, disdain and incomprehension. Between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, French soldiers battled in the Holy Land; for several hundred years after that, France and the Ottoman Empire exchanged diplomats, traders and slaves. The colonial occupation of Algeria that began in 1830 ended violently in 1962. By then, the empire that struck back had also come home through large waves of immigration. Today, the social and economic status, religious affiliation, political significance and cultural impact of French citizens of North African descent are the subject of burning national debate. Taking a long view on Franco-Muslim relations, the course will explore such topics as the Crusades, Mediterranean piracy and captivity, Napoleon's Egyptian campaign, the Algerian War of Independence, the \"veil affair,\" riots in the suburbs of Paris and World Cup soccer. \nOffered asETHS\u00a0234andHSTY\u00a0234.

The European experience of the regimentation of the economy and daily life, the impact of new technology on warfare, and the very personal suffering of separation and loss changed how those on that continent viewed their countries and their world.  The war affected everything from gender relations to class relations to religious and ethnic relations and laid the foundation for even more disruption ahead.

Many might come to the course with images of the American \"Bands of Brothers\" fighting across France in 1944. But that was the end of the war. In the beginning, it fell to the British leadership (famously embodied by Winston Churchill), British people, and to an extraordinary extent the Indian Army to withstand a pummeling at the hands of the Axis powers long enough for America to join the conflict. The course will examine those in Britain who might have preferred a move towards Fascism in the late 1930s. It will investigate why imperial subjects who lacked democracy in their own lands fought for the British in the name of democracy against totalitarianism. And it will scrutinize those in the Empire who instead sided with the Axis. In sum, students will have an opportunity to learn what led to those many moments of choice and chance that led to Allied victory and the defeat of Fascism.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "Consumption has been central to American political, economic, and social life. Americans have engaged in individual and collective action as consumers to fight corporate malfeasance, to influence legislators, and to assert consumers' rights. Yet being a consumer is also a political practice, and forms of consumer activism have been central to some of the most important struggles for social justice, political rights, and freedom in America. This seminar examines the connections between consumption and politics by looking at the role that consumer identities and activism played in various social movements throughout the twentieth century, from the Kosher Meat Boycott of 1902 to the present. By reading primary and secondary sources, we will examine how consumption was a means to challenge gender, race, and class barriers, to claim equality and citizenship, and to fight social injustice. However, in looking at these struggles over access, control, and rights, we will also examine how the focus on consumption was used to co-opt subversive political messages and to contain radicalism."

    "description": "The core principle of this course is that public health is a concept that was formed in different ways at different times in different places.  It had no existence as we know it before the nineteenth century, but course participants will learn how it grew out of an ancient tradition of the political elite's concern that its subjects were a threat to them and the stability of the realm.  Course participants will discover how, in the nineteenth century, it became a professional practice as we know it and realized advances in human health, longevity, and security perhaps greater than any made since.  At the same time, the course will also cover how many of the assumptions of those that inaugurated public health were completely alien to present-day practitioners--even though in many ways it is a practice that helped inaugurate the modern world so familiar to us.  Course participants will learn about the close relationship between public health agencies and agendas and various kinds of social authority: political power, moral influence, colonial power, and others.  Ultimately, the aim of the course is to show participants that even though public health seems a supremely common-sense practice, it had a highly contested birth and early life that was anything but natural or pre-ordained.  That complicated birth continues to shape public health to this day. Counts as a CAS Global & Cultural Diversity course.  Counts as a Human Diversity & Commonality course.

Although it seems as though the body is a fixed, a-historical category, in recent years, historians found it to be a valuable source to understand questions of race, gender, sexuality, class, nationalism, citizenship, as well as political and social institutions. In this course, readings, lectures, discussions, and writing assignments will all explore the body as a locus of social meaning, giving a special attention to the aesthetics of the body and notions of beauty. We will examine how different characterizations of bodies -- male and female, enslaved and free, healthy and sick, able and disable, active and idle, natural and artificial, normal and deviant -- were constructed and imagined for different purposes, giving special attention to how the diversity of lived experiences of bodies as well as their symbolic meanings can shed light on social, political and historical processes. In addition, class readings, discussions, and assignments will encourage students to critically examine the political meanings of bodies and the ethical questions that derive from the social organization and definitions of different bodies, considering issues such as slavery, eugenics, disability, and medical ethics.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "Since the late seventeenth century, American readers have been endlessly fascinated by the subjects of crime and punishment-and especially by murders and other violent offenses committed in their own communities. Much as Americans today \"consume\" crime through movies, television, newspapers, magazines, mystery novels, \"true crime\" books, websites, podcasts, and popular music, so also did Americans of the 1670s through 1850s \"consume\" crime through a variety of popular genres, including execution sermons, criminal (auto)biographies, trial reports, and murder ballads. Since most convicted criminals in early America came from non-elite backgrounds (and often belonged to oppressed or otherwise subordinated social groups, including African Americans and Native Americans), such publications not only shed light on crime, punishment, the legal system, normative social values, power relations, and popular culture, but also provide historians with some of their most valuable sources on the day-to-day experiences of ordinary men and women. This seminar explores all of these topics. Each week, students will read topically-related clusters of early crime publications, usually in conjunction with relevant modern scholarship drawn from the fields of social history, legal history, psychology, criminology, and literary studies. The types of crimes explored include witchcraft, piracy, burglary, robbery, and various types of homicide, such as infanticide, familicide (men murdering their wives and children), and sexual homicide (or courtship murder). Each student will write several short analytical papers drawn from the shared readings and, at the end of the semester, complete an independent multi-modal, multi-draft research project."

We will explore the major historical transformations (political, economic, social, and cultural) of the last imperial dynasty, the Qing (1644-1911), and develop an understanding of the major social, political, economic, and intellectual cultural forces shaping the formation of modern China.  Contrary to commonly-held ideas in both West and in China that traditional Chinese society was timeless or stagnant, historians now see dramatic and significant changes during this period--to the economy, to gender relations, to religion, and to many other aspects of life.  This course surveys the social, political, economic, and cultural history of this era, with emphasis on recent research.  The main goals of the course will be to acquaint students with the key changes and to show the interplay between economic, social, and cultural changes on the one hand and political developments on the other.  By the end of the semester you should have a good sense of how Chinese society was transformed over the course of the 17th through early 20th centuries.  The topics we will discuss include urbanization and commerce; gender, family and kinship; education and the examination system; opium and free trade; and ethnicity and nationalism.\nOffered asASIA\u00a0288andHSTY\u00a0288.

In contrast to the conventional description of China from a Western point of view, this course tries to explain the emergence of modern China in the context of its intellectual, political, and socio-economic transformation as experienced by Chinese in the late 19th and into the 20th century.  By discussing the influence of the West, domestic rebellions, and political radicalism, we examine how the Chinese state and society interacted in search for modernization and reforms, how these reforms were continued during the Republican period, and to what extent historical patterns can be identified in China's present-day development.\nOffered asASIA\u00a0289andHSTY\u00a0289.

Like humans, nature, too, has a history, and its meanings, boundaries, and uses have changed dramatically over time. By studying those changes, we gain insight not merely into the world we inhabit and the ways that we have shaped it, for better or worse, but also into ourselves--our beliefs, values, and ambitions. The course will cover approaches to nature from the ancient Greeks to the modern anthropocene. We will look at how nature has been understood over time not only through texts but also through art, objects, and film.  The course will include visits (real or virtual) to various local sites in order for us to pursue these themes in a hands-on way.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "Religious persecution during the early modern period (16th-18th centuries) compelled Jews to attend Mass, Muslims to baptize their children and Protestants to count Hail Marys on a rosary. European exploration of Asia, Africa and the Americas inspired an Englishman to pass himself off as Taiwanese and an African to present himself as a European. The choice between marriage and a convent led one woman to cut off her hair, sew her skirt into britches and make herself into a conquistador in Peru. In pursuit of social mobility, courtiers remade themselves to suit the conventions of the court. Posing, passing and pretending, these Europeans crossed lines of religion, gender, race and class. Today we might call some of these figures impostors but praise others as self-made men and women. What was the difference between lying and self-fashioning in sixteenth-, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe? What forces and phenomena compelled people to remake themselves? Was the early modern period the age of identity theft?"

Perspectives on work, worker organizations, employers, and the response of large industrial entities in historical and contemporary contexts, will be considered as these perspectives were shaped by immigrant status, race, ethnicity, religious views, as well as local and global economic, political, and social factors. The course is designed to provide students the knowledge and tools needed to manage effectively and collaboratively with unions. Themes include \"Who Built America,\" a history of laboring people in America, the organization of workers and accompanying management ideologies, the relationship of unions to productivity and Democratic processes. We will study how immigrant organizations, established Churches, and local political parties reacted to early union organizing movements as well as the reaction of political and industrial elites. Readings and discussions will also cover the sources and forms of conflict between workers and employers, changes in technology, production, and workplace organization in an emerging market and capitalistic society. Students will consider the impact of immigration, racism and sexism in the labor movement and diverse types of unions and worker associations formed during select periods in American history. Throughout the course we will revisit the on-going debate over the goals and purposes of unions and best ways to manage the organizational and political processes associated with unionization. Students will study how labor unions were and are affected by an international economy as well as how working people and their unions impacted and shaped society and political processes through sometimes mutual (and often antagonistic) interaction. We will look at how the labor movement's ability to improve their members' living standards and working conditions widely fluctuated throughout history. Students will have an opportunity to engage with local unions and union management organizations to study contemporary local and global questions and controversies surrounding police unions, those representing Amazon or Starbucks employees, and the actions of unions in entertainment or sports industry. We will revisit best practices; essential for those who will eventually manage in industry, international corporations, arts and education, and the non-profit world, to work empathetically, collaboratively, and efficiently with unionized employees.

    "description": "The British Empire took control of Palestine after driving the Germans and Turks from the region near the end of World War I.  From that moment on, the British had an increasingly difficult time administering the region.  Jewish colonists had already been settling in the land for decades, and with their takeover, the British gave them and other Zionists reason to believe that the Empire would facilitate Jewish efforts.  At the same time, the indigenous Arabs of Palestine appealed to the British to protect their very birthright, to keep their country from passing into someone else's hands.  The British gave Arabs, too, reason to believe that they would recognize and defend their claims.  In the few decades that the British Mandate governed Palestine it oversaw riots, revolution, and terrorist bombings.  When it withdrew from Palestine, its legacy was a brutal war between Arabs and Jews; and the legacy of that war holds an iron grip on the course of world history to this day.  Had the British Empire not been in Palestine, and not made the fateful decisions that it did, there would be no Israel and no Arab-Israeli conflict as we know them.  Course materials include histories of Zionism, pre-Zionist Palestine, the British Mandate years, the British Empire in other Arab lands, and the 1948 war and aftermath.

Diamond, a physiologist, explains that Western Europe came to occupy and dominate large areas of the globe because of natural resources present in certain regions of the Old World since the end of the last Ice Age.  Where a historian might look for answers in the written evidence left by historical individuals, Diamond examines ancient patterns of plant diffusion or the place of mountain ranges and deserts in the development of technologies.  This seminar is about applying the history of a specific time and place namely North America from European contact to 1850 - to Diamond's general environmental explanations and models.  Placing Diamond's broad explanations within specific historical contexts is revealing.  A range of alternative methods, perspectives, primary sources from North America, and case studies (especially within environmental history) help develop a critical understanding of the complexities of European expansion into the New World.  The course engages in an extended comparative exploration of the worldviews of different world cultures, most extensively comparing European worldviews with Native American, but also paying significant attention to Asian worldviews.  The Native American cultures under consideration include those of both North and South America. Counts as a CAS Global & Cultural Diversity course."

This includes a recognition that Native America was a diverse place with many cultures constructed with distinct racial, gender, religious, and economic class structures, which will be given significant attention in this course. \n\nIn addition to these themes, we will consider methodology, conceptual frameworks, and research challenges and strategies that inform the researching and writing of Native American history.  These include expanding the \"archive\", \"decolonizing\" our choice of terms and frameworks, reconsidering borders (national, colonial, historical), discussing new best practices about engagement with Indigenous subjects/communities as part of scholarship, looking beyond the gender assumptions of those who created documents at the base of much documentary evidence.\nOffered asHSTY\u00a0357andHSTY\u00a0457.

    "description": "Children have been growing up in the United States since it was declared independent, in 1776, but how adults conceive of (and therefore legislate and interpret) children and childhood constantly changes to fit current circumstances.  The experiences of children themselves have varied not only in terms of race, class, gender, and religion but also depending on specific events (i.e., coming of age during the Civil War versus the Civil Rights movement) or geography (i.e., growing up in rural Hawaii vs. urban New Jersey).  We cannot cover all of those histories in one course, so this seminar course instead focuses on exploring the interplay of ideas about children and the expressed or historical experiences of children.  When the puritans and plantations members (slave, bonded and free) came to the Atlantic shore, they brought with them particular ideas about what is meant to be a child, and to experience childhood.  They encountered already established residents who also had ideas about childhood.  How did those concepts adjust/meld/contrast over time, and how do we see those ideas reflected or reshaped by actual experiences?  This course engages particular lines of inquiry:  How and why do understanding about what is \"natural\" for children change over time?  How do variables like race, class, gender, etc., uphold effects the manifesting of such concepts?  What is the role of the state in children's lives and how has that changed over time?

In the beginning, it fell to the British leadership (famously embodied by Winston Churchill), British people, and to an extraordinary extent the Indian Army to withstand a pummeling at the hands of the Axis powers long enough for America to join the conflict. The course will examine those in Britain who might have preferred a move towards Fascism in the late 1930s. It will investigate why imperial subjects who lacked democracy in their own lands fought for the British in the name of democracy against totalitarianism. And it will scrutinize those in the Empire who instead sided with the Axis.

We will supplement these works with key articles and classic studies in order to assess scholarly trends that have shaped the field, particularly in the last decade.  \n\nStudents will consider how Native Americans experienced enormous economic, demographic, cultural and political challenges, and what kinds of strategies for survival they employed. This course will examine interactions between sovereign Native American nations, European empires, and the United States from Indigenous perspectives. This includes a recognition that Native America was a diverse place with many cultures constructed with distinct racial, gender, religious, and economic class structures, which will be given significant attention in this course. \n\nIn addition to these themes, we will consider methodology, conceptual frameworks, and research challenges and strategies that inform the researching and writing of Native American history.  These include expanding the \"archive\", \"decolonizing\" our choice of terms and frameworks, reconsidering borders (national, colonial, historical), discussing new best practices about engagement with Indigenous subjects/communities as part of scholarship, looking beyond the gender assumptions of those who created documents at the base of much documentary evidence.\nOffered asHSTY\u00a0357andHSTY\u00a0457.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "Current scientific and technological innovations inspire a need to weigh and evaluate information like never before, while navigating the digital world has become a critically important practice. In other words, we must interrogate information instead of passively receiving it as we encounter news, research, and everyday communications. Where scholarly conversations found in books and journal articles form the backbone of academic discourse, these are not the only sources of knowledge worth sharing and not the only forums where valuable conversations take place. These other sources of information and venues for sharing knowledge include digital conversations and knowledge distribution on platforms that include TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia, among others. The fundamental question this course seeks to answer is: How do we leverage a multitude of information sources to become more thoughtful and more literate when interacting with the knowledge produced within the digital world? Throughout this course, we will examine different online communities that generate information, from TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube to other outlets such as Wikipedia and the search engines that lead us there. These communities will revolve around an intersectional combination of gender, race, class, and sexuality. Our goal is to explore where and how online knowledge is formed, who forms that knowledge through community engagement, and how it is dispersed to better understand the information networks we rely upon and to put them in social and cultural contexts. Broader questions we will consider and discuss include issues of equity and access to information, how does information lead to knowledge, who dominates information distributed within online conversations, and how do other voices carve out spaces for themselves via diverse communities. Assignments will model the research and writing process and will build towards a substantive research paper alongside a multimedia presentation in the style of a TikTok video or a specialized website focused on a given online community in order to best serve as a communications-oriented course.

This course introduces students to a branch of psychology that considers the mind to be fundamentally connected to the planet on which it evolved and exists, Ecopsychology. Ecopsychology's goal is to support the pursuit of ecological justice by transforming people's psychological orientations toward the natural world and the ecological crisis. In this class, we'll consider the relationship between the mechanistic thinking of mainstream cognitive science and historical and ongoing environmental and racial injustice. We'll consider the consequences of disconnection from our planet for our physical, mental, and social health. You will read, write, reflect, and get to know places and people in our community. These class activities will 1) allow you to develop and apply wellness-related knowledge in pursuit of a healthy lifestyle and improved quality of life for yourself and your community, 2) develop civic and societal responsibility and a deeper understanding of communities in Cleveland.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "From concepts of premodern warriors calling out their names before doing hand-to-hand combat to modern salary men crushing the world with their economic prowess, samurai have come to be an iconic image of the Japanese people. Throughout the semester we will pay particular attention to the central themes in the historiography of warrior society, roughly, the years between ca. 1110 and 1850 C.E. We will investigate how these documents were translated by modern societies, both east and west, in samurai film.\nStudents will explore the category of \"samurai\" through reading selections from The Tale of the Heike, as well as selected Noh plays, legal documents, travel diaries, autobiographies, short stories, and historical texts. In addition, we will investigate other genres contributing to the construction of the idea of \"samurai,\" such as film.  This seminar will closely examine the concept of \"samurai,\" particularly its connection to the Japanese identity using an interdisciplinary context of the arts, history, religion, and literature. We will also explore the ways in which daimyo (feudal lords), authors, Buddhist officials, and filmmakers throughout the world created, shaped, and altered the ideal image of the samurai. Key to understanding the concept of samurai will be wrestling with questions of authorship, spirit pacification, nationality, and patronage, with specific focus on the Japanese relationship with Western nations and cultures.\nWe will focus on language and its role in legitimizing the global concepts of \"samurai\" and \"bushido.\" This class will provide additional insight geared toward the cultural study of linguistic identities beyond those informed by the English language and will include terms expressed in Japanese. Many of the resources used in this course will be translated from the Japanese, allowing us to consider Naoki Sakai's theories of enunciation/ translation/ subjectivity, Haruo Shirane's theory of reception, and Michael Emmerich's theory of replacement. Especially important will be to focus on terms in Japanese with no, or poor, English equivalent (such as samurai, shogun, daimyo, bushido, etc.) but with clear images in the English-speaking imagination(s).\nThe instructor will provide background information on political, cultural, and religious history. Class sessions will be conducted in English and combine lectures, discussion, audio-visual materials, and creative as well as analytical writing exercises. All readings and films will be in English or with English subtitle.\nOffered asJAPN\u00a0265andWLIT\u00a0265. Counts as a CAS Global & Cultural Diversity course.

Western and Asian literary theories, especially those concerning topics of translation, replacement, negotiation with classics, and gender and sexuality will also be extensively explored.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "In premodern Japan, it was not only death and mourning ritual and practice that could pacify the spirit of the deceased, but also language. Authors consciously crafted the words of their works to simultaneously express the grief associated with longing and pacify the spirits of the dead. These words are called kotodama (power of words). From as far back as the eighth-century Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters) and Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan) textual representations of mourning were linked with special uses of language and spirit pacification. At the death of Ame-no-wakahiko (a mythological god), his parents constructed a mourning hut and performed songs to secure his spirit in the afterworld. As several authors have demonstrated, from kotodama in the mid-eighth-century poetic anthology Man'y'sh, (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) to linked verse (renga) in medieval Japan, carefully constructed literary language also had a place in ritual pacification of the spirits of the dead. Words were not simple expressions of grief; they held power. \nAll material is in English translation. The course is conducted in English. All material will be provided via PDF.\nOffered asJAPN\u00a0341andWLIT\u00a0341andRLGN\u00a0341. Counts as a CAS Global & Cultural Diversity course.  Counts as a Communication Intensive course.

Along our journey, we examine how Jews have navigated their experiences as minorities in their many diaspora homelands, and how they have they adapted their cultural and religious practices to the various environments in which they have found themselves.  In addition to exploring their Jewishness vis-\u00e0-vis others, we also examine questions of exclusion and belonging that Jews have faced as they have encountered each another in recent decades through tourism, mass migration, globalization, and the internet. How do the world's varied Jewish groups - who are of different skin colors, who speak different languages, and who carry different historical memories - navigate ethnic divides, race relations, and religious diversity?

How are notions of exile and homeland, always central to space and identity, transformed as they are grounded in actual geographic sites?

Other legal norms, such as standards, will also will explored, and the question will be posed: when ought the law to use rules, and when standards? The centrality of such norms to the enterprise we call law will be examined, as well as the question of whether such norms are binding upon the citizen. We consider the nature of justice and how it relates to law, as well as how legal entitlements are structured in terms of rights and privileges. We also examine how these ideas shed light on the nature of legal reasoning. Along the way, we will discuss one of the most common problems generated by misunderstanding the nature of rules and standards: the many confusions surrounding the notion of a stereotype. We pose the question: when and why is decision-making by use of a stereotype improper?  In this context, we will examine a number of issues of age, gender, and racial discrimination, among others."

In doing so we will draw on a variety of primary materials, including cases, extracts from memoirs and oral histories, film, and literature, and secondary materials, drawing mostly on the work of legal scholars, lawyers, and historians. Among the topics that we will consider will be law's role in the Civil Rights movement and the challenges raised by many in the movement to reliance on law as a means to achieving freedom and equality, law and the Vietnam War, and the struggle for control over university space engaged in by students, and their supporters along with university administrators and their supporters (Yes, I know this last one sounds quite familiar). One of the questions that we will be asking ourselves is to what extent was Sixties law distinctive. One of the possible distinguishing characteristics of some law of that period was the willingness of courts to expand their reach to institutions that had previously been accorded much deference of courts. Some of these institutions include, police courts (similar to night court of tv sit-com fame), police headquarters, schools, mental hospitals, prisons, and the military. Depending on particular areas of student interest, we will explore whether or not law changed in the Sixties in regard to the exercise of state, or state supported, power over individuals in these settings.\nThis is a seminar which meets once a week.  Consequently, class attendance is very important. Students will write a paper, which can fulfill the writing requirement if the student hasn't yet done so. Cleveland and Northeast Ohio play a prominent role in our legal history, and students are encouraged to consider writing on a topic connected to the area. The paper will be the principle basis for the grade, but class participation and each student's presentation of their work in the last two weeks of class will also constitute a portion of the grade."

Important factors in second language learning will be identified and discussed. These include: age-related differences, the influence of the first language, the role played by innate (universal) principles, the role of memory processes, attitudes, motivation, personality and cognitive styles, and formal versus naturalistic learning contexts.

Innovation is a driver of regional economic development and wealth creation in organizational units ranging in size from the start-up to the Fortune 500 companies.  In a broader context, the pace of translational research leading to product and service innovation is highly interdisciplinary, thus, new products and services result from team efforts, marked by a systematic, structured approach to bringing new medical technologies to market and impacting patient care.  In this course we examine medical technology innovations in the context of (A) addressing unmet clinical needs, (B) the process of inventing new medical devices and instruments, and (C) subsequent implementation of these advances in patient care.

While we often think about progress in terms of the practical application of, say, imaging to the diagnosis and monitoring of disease, technology is increasingly expected to improve the organization and delivery of healthcare services, too.  Information technology plays a key role in the transformation of administrative support systems (finance and administration), clinical information systems (information to support patient care), and decision support systems (managerial decision-making).  This introductory graduate course provides the student with the opportunity to gain insight and situational experience with clinical information systems (CIS).  Often considered synonymous with electronic medical records, the \"art\" of CIS more fundamentally examines the effective use of data and information technology to assist in the migration away from paper-based systems and improve organizational performance.  In this course we examine clinical information systems in the context of (A) operational and strategic information needs, (B) information technology and analytic tools for workflow design, and (C) subsequent implementation of clinical information systems in patient care.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "Designing is giving form to an idea for a more desirable product, service, process or organization, and refining the idea into something that can be delivered reliably and efficiently. Good design integrates these evolving ideas with the day-to-day realities of a firms' operations, systems, marketing, economics, finance and human resources. Designing is thus a unique managerial activity that brings together changing technologies, capabilities, relationships, activities and materials to shape an organization's plans and strategies. It combines analysis and synthesis to create opportunities for improvement and means of attaining them. Viewed this way, designing is a core competence of a successful entrepreneur or innovative leader. Design analysis is the systematic review of the four orders of design found in every firm--namely, the firm's communications, products, interactions and environments--and the creation of opportunities to increase firm value by improving each. Students will identify ill-defined, ill-structured problems within organizations. Such problems are ones for which there are no definitive formulations and for which the formulation chosen affects the solutions available. For such problems, there is no explicit way of knowing when you have reached a solution, and solutions cannot necessarily be considered correct or incorrect. But finding innovative solutions to such problems can provide unique opportunities to create exceptional value.  A major outcome of the semester's inquiry is a presentation of the design problem and proposed design solution.\nPrereq: This course is for students in the Part-time Cohort MBA Program."

Days of the year were tracked according to the Church calendar and the time of day was told in relation to the numerous daily Church services, in which virtually everything was sung. Many of the architectural wonders of this period were churches and private chapels, and there was an explosion of religious music and art meant to adorn the liturgical celebrations that took place within these spaces. This seminar explores connections between Christian liturgical services (especially the Mass), musical compositions (Gregorian chant, masses, motets, and other choral works), and visual artworks (paintings, sculptures, altarpieces, and illuminated manuscripts) from these centuries, all of which shared a common vocabulary of sacred texts, images, and symbols.

New forms of media and circulation continue to radically connect disparate people groups and encourage ongoing hybridity of cultural expression.

    "description": "Charles Long suggests that black musical forms are creative responses to the particular circumstances of black peoples' presence in the U.S and black notions of the sacred. In April of 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 released her visual album Lemonade two days after the death of Prince. This course is organized around the album's title cuts and links these two artists together in an examination of religion and musical performance as creative response to the racial and gendered conditions of black life. The course investigates how both artists have used music as a platform to explore issues of race, gender, commerce, sexuality, power and divinity. The course also looks at examples from the works of earlier artists who address similar themes such as Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Muddy Waters, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Little Richard, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, and Aretha Franklin.\nOffered asAFST\u00a0302,ETHS\u00a0302,MUHI\u00a0316,RLGN\u00a0302,RLGN\u00a0402, andWGST\u00a0302.

    "description": "This course examines historical and present-day intersections between music and neuroscience. Bringing together histories of medicine, sound studies, critical neuroscience, music psychology, and cognitive science, it invites students to contemplate how music shaped our conception of the brain and nervous system, as well as how auditory cultures were shaped by emerging neuroscientific theory. From the eighteenth century onward, theories of cerebral function borrowed musical instruments as metaphorical proxies: the brain was likened to a harp, a keyboard, a violin, a phonograph, and an orchestra. Sound itself was conceived as an electric medium capable of stimulating or soothing the nerves, inducing trance states, or provoking what Alan Richardson calls the neural sublime.The study of neurological disorders including aphasia helped concretize late-nineteenth-century cortical maps, laying the groundwork for the first scientific work on music cognition. Today, we use music and sound to stimulate long-term memory in individuals with Alzheimers, teach the blind to see via echolocation, and facilitate communication in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. As we trace these developments across the semester, we contemplate the aesthetic and social aspects of neuroscience and the crucial ways in which auditory and neurological discourses have interfaced. Counts as a SAGES Departmental Seminar course."

It seeks to develop the analytical skills of music historians, deepening their earlier technical training and teaching them how to approach repertories (music before 1700, after 1900, popular music) they are unlikely to have studied in depth previously.  In contrast to the instruction offered at CIM, this seminar will present a range of ways in which to bridge between the details of a musical composition and the historical context within which it first appeared. \nThe seminar deals with five case studies, one representative of each of the following repertories:\nBefore 1700 (e.g., Josquin motets, Monteverdi madrigals, Frescobaldi toccatas)\n1700-1820 (e.g., Rameau keyboard suites, Beethoven sonatas, Schubert string quartets)\n1820-1910 (e.g., Berlioz Symphonie Fantastique, Brahms symphonies, Mahler songs)\nAfter 1910 (e.g., Stravinsky Sacre du Printemps, Webern Symphony, Ruth Crawford Seeger String Quartet, Ligeti Etudes)\nPopular Music (e.g. 12-bar blues, \"rhythm changes,\" \"Round Midnights\")\nOf these, most students will have received training only in the analysis of music 1700-1820, and that training will have concentrated strictly on harmony and structure, without engagement with cultural context.  Each unit of this seminar will proceed from basic grammatical norms for the repertory in question to formal criticism to cultural interpretation."

    "description": "The nervous system exhibits an extraordinary capability for controlling complex behavior through processing of sensory input and storage of information. This capability primarily arises from interactions of specific groups of neurons which form circuits. This course will explore the structure and function of a diverse set of neural circuits in order to understand how the nervous system controls complex behavior. Mechanisms that govern the development and maturation of neural circuits will be defined. Neural circuits for sensory, motor, and emotional behaviors will be described in 3 ways: 1) Which brain regions/nuclei are connected in each circuit. 2) How these regions of the nervous system communicate with one another through identification and classification of individual neurons in the circuit. 3) How the input/output of each circuit relates to behavior and function. Throughout the course, students will learn how disease, trauma, or dysfunction specifically affects each circuit to result in impairment/loss of normal function.\nOffered asNEUR\u00a0316andNEUR\u00a0416."

Perspectives on work, worker organizations, employers, and the response of large industrial entities in historical and contemporary contexts, will be considered as these perspectives were shaped by immigrant status, race, ethnicity, religious views, as well as local and global economic, political, and social factors. The course is designed to provide students the knowledge and tools needed to manage effectively and collaboratively with unions. Themes include \"Who Built America,\" a history of laboring people in America, the organization of workers and accompanying management ideologies, the relationship of unions to productivity and Democratic processes. We will study how immigrant organizations, established Churches, and local political parties reacted to early union organizing movements as well as the reaction of political and industrial elites. Readings and discussions will also cover the sources and forms of conflict between workers and employers, changes in technology, production, and workplace organization in an emerging market and capitalistic society. Students will consider the impact of immigration, racism and sexism in the labor movement and diverse types of unions and worker associations formed during select periods in American history. Throughout the course we will revisit the on-going debate over the goals and purposes of unions and best ways to manage the organizational and political processes associated with unionization. Students will study how labor unions were and are affected by an international economy as well as how working people and their unions impacted and shaped society and political processes through sometimes mutual (and often antagonistic) interaction. We will look at how the labor movement's ability to improve their members' living standards and working conditions widely fluctuated throughout history. Students will have an opportunity to engage with local unions and union management organizations to study contemporary local and global questions and controversies surrounding police unions, those representing Amazon or Starbucks employees, and the actions of unions in entertainment or sports industry.

This is an introductory course on negotiations, or on the art and science of securing agreements between two or more parties who are interdependent and who are seeking to maximize their outcomes. Understanding your own negotiation style and what drives others in negotiations is essential for success at negotiating. This kind of knowledge can only be gained through experience and this course provides a series of simulations and debriefings that address a variety of bargaining processes in the contexts of deal making and dispute resolution. A central thread across the negotiation simulation experience is the ethical character that you will exercise and develop over time; our planning and execution of negotiation strategy will take into account virtue ethics and character strengths. By the end of these experiences, students will be able to identify and evaluate moral and ethical aspects of the interpersonal bargaining and conflict management situations they will face. Counts as a Full-Semester Wellness/Non-movement course.  Counts as a Moral & Ethical Reasoning course.\nPrereq: At least sophomore standing."

This course presents a proven, innovative and strength-based approach to accelerating organizational change -- Appreciative Inquiry (AI). The original theory and method of Appreciative Inquiry was invented in Case Western Reserve University's Department of Organizational Behavior in the 1980's by Dr. David Cooperrider and Dr. Ron Fry. In the years since there have been hundreds of scholars, leaders, consultants, and students involved in bringing Appreciative Inquiry's strength-centric spirit of inquiry into organizations and communities all over the world. As one scholar recently wrote, \"AI is revolutionizing the field of organization development and change.\" Appreciative Inquiry focuses on searching systematically for those capacities and processes that give life, strength, and possibility to a living system. As a constructive mode of practice, it aims at designing, improving, and innovating human organizations through a process in which valuing and creating are viewed as one, and where inquiry and change are powerfully related and understood as a seamless and integral whole."

They soon learn, however, that negotiation skills can do far more than improve a paycheck. Negotiations occur everywhere: in marriages, in divorces, in small work teams, in large organizations, in getting a job, in losing a job, in deal making, in decision making, in board rooms, and in court rooms. The remarkable thing about negotiations is that, wherever they occur, they are governed by similar principles. The current wave of corporate restructuring makes the study of negotiations especially important for M.B.A.s. Mergers, acquisitions, downsizing and joint ventures call into question well established business and employment relationships. Navigating these choppy waters by building new relationships requires the negotiation skills that you will learn in this class. \nOffered asECON\u00a0431andORBH\u00a0413."

One such choice is whether to focus a company's for-profit activities only on \"doing less harm\", or to choose to also pursue \"making a positive impact\" through activities that increase prosperity, improve wellbeing, and regenerate nature. Other such choices are critically examined during the semester. The goal is changing who leaders are being, not only what they are doing, through daily practices that increase their awareness of how their actions impact others and the world. Through the course, students experiment with a variety of practices in an action learning process that allows them to experience a greater connection to self, others, and nature. Recent research shows that such direct-intuitive practices support personal wellbeing, team collaboration, and corporate citizenship behavior as part of an upward spiral in leadership effectiveness and life satisfaction.

Open to all students (no pre-requisites), this course combines intellectual inquiry with experiential approaches, blending philosophical insight, evidence-based interventions and cutting-edge science. For instance, students will learn about approaches to emotion regulation and stress resilience all the way from the ancient Stoics to recently published work in psychological science.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "Traditional theories of knowledge have concentrated on the actions and beliefs of individuals, and how they marshal evidence from the world to support or refute their scientific hypotheses. This traditional epistemological framework has been challenged by the developments of the modern era of Big Science, resulting in the development of new approaches to a social epistemology of science.  Reflective of how science is done, this epistemological framework in turn can provide guidance for the robust prosecution of the scientific enterprise.  Perhaps nowhere is this more important than in climate science, where on the one hand the underlying dynamics of climate change pose an existential threat to our civilization, and on the other, there are active and well organized efforts to derail the scientific process and to denigrate the scientists.\nThis course will first develop classical notions of the epistemology of science, including the role of models and issues of uncertainty (statistical, systematic, and gross) as well as the challenges of developing a robust scientific process resistant to fraud. These issues will be illustrated by consideration of various classical experiments.  The course will then expand the epistemological framework to the collaborative context of modern big science, illustrating the issues by examples from the field of high energy physics (which saw the development of the World Wide Web by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, to allow physicists from around the world to share and collectively analyze data).  With this in hand the course will explore the history and current state of climate science in the framework of a social epistemology of big science. Students will develop a good understanding of the role of hierarchical models of climate science, the empirical basis for our current understanding of anthropogenic climate change, the role and development of international coordination of climate science and its implications for policy, and the challenges posed by hostile, well-organized efforts to disrupt the scientific process, the public understanding of the science, and ultimately the processes necessary for addressing the challenges of climate change.\nOffered asPHIL\u00a0261andPHYS\u00a0261."

The second half of the course further explores the interplay between scientific and ethical perspectives by examining a series of topics. Questions of interest: Is free will necessary for moral responsibility? When we say an entity is conscious is that equivalent to saying we are obliged to care about its experience (i.e. treat it as a moral patient)? Will science ever be able to determine if an entity is conscious and/or has free will? Are these instead ethical questions? What is the relationship between scientific and ethical modes of understanding? How do these two modes of understanding influence how we think about other everyday phenomena?

The course will explore the limits of scientific understanding and the relationship between science and ethics through an initial focus on two classic issues in philosophy of mind: the problem of consciousness and the problem of free will. The second half of the course further explores the interplay between scientific and ethical perspectives by examining a series of topics. Questions of interest: Is free will necessary for moral responsibility? When we say an entity is conscious is that equivalent to saying we are obliged to care about its experience (i.e. treat it as a moral patient)? Will science ever be able to determine if an entity is conscious and/or has free will? Are these instead ethical questions? What is the relationship between scientific and ethical modes of understanding? How do these two modes of understanding influence how we think about other everyday phenomena? The only pre-requisite to enroll in this course is curiosity, although students may benefit from having previously taken courses in philosophy, neuroscience, psychology and/or computer science.\nOffered asPHIL\u00a0366andPHIL\u00a0466.

This traditional epistemological framework has been challenged by the developments of the modern era of Big Science, resulting in the development of new approaches to a social epistemology of science.  Reflective of how science is done, this epistemological framework in turn can provide guidance for the robust prosecution of the scientific enterprise.  Perhaps nowhere is this more important than in climate science, where on the one hand the underlying dynamics of climate change pose an existential threat to our civilization, and on the other, there are active and well organized efforts to derail the scientific process and to denigrate the scientists.\nThis course will first develop classical notions of the epistemology of science, including the role of models and issues of uncertainty (statistical, systematic, and gross) as well as the challenges of developing a robust scientific process resistant to fraud. These issues will be illustrated by consideration of various classical experiments.  The course will then expand the epistemological framework to the collaborative context of modern big science, illustrating the issues by examples from the field of high energy physics (which saw the development of the World Wide Web by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, to allow physicists from around the world to share and collectively analyze data).  With this in hand the course will explore the history and current state of climate science in the framework of a social epistemology of big science. Students will develop a good understanding of the role of hierarchical models of climate science, the empirical basis for our current understanding of anthropogenic climate change, the role and development of international coordination of climate science and its implications for policy, and the challenges posed by hostile, well-organized efforts to disrupt the scientific process, the public understanding of the science, and ultimately the processes necessary for addressing the challenges of climate change.\nOffered asPHIL\u00a0261andPHYS\u00a0261."

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "Introduction to Aerospace I is organized into five blocks clustering around concepts of cell biology, neural systems, cardiopulmonary functions, and renal adaptation. Scenarios in acute, sub-acute, and chronic responses to the challenge of the aerospace environment illustrate useful physiology and unique responses relevant to high performance aircraft and space exploration.\nBlock I: Physiology of Cells and Molecules\nGenes, proteins, cellular communication and organ system functions are building blocks of human physiologic responses. These are modified by such aerospace exposures such as microgravity. Immediate adjustments are the result of connected physiology by cell-to-cell contact, neuronal connection, and hormone release, but sub-acute and chronic exposures engage remodeling from experience, mitigation by pre-flight activities, or achievement of a new steady state.\nAfter Aerospace Physiology I, the student will be able to name the cellular sequences of gene expression to functional proteins, identify how an environmental exposure can be sensed and initiate a response, and list ways that cells communicate to produce systemic effects. Some relevant examples will include microgravity and radiation effects on bone loss and muscle functions, skeletal muscle contraction, smooth muscle regulation in blood vessels, and cardiac contraction.\nBlock II: Neurophysiology\nThe purpose of the neural system is in recognition and reaction of the brain and nervous system to the environment stress and the transduction of the sensory experience, resulting in both conscious and unconscious responses to adjust to the perturbation. Sometimes these are smooth but in aerospace environments, initial human responses (dizziness, loss of situational awareness, and fatigue) are detrimental to optimal performance.\nAfter Introduction to Aerospace Physiology I, the learner will be able to list the anatomic features of the nervous system, its neural efferent and afferent information trafficking, the function of the autonomic nervous system, and neural circuits in the brain and spinal cord.\nBlock III: Cardiovascular Physiology\nThe ability to tolerate the 6G acceleration in high performance aircraft is in large part due to the capacity and limitation of the cardiovascular system (one designed to adjust to earth's atmosphere-1G) to respond to changes in posture, flight-or-flight, or volume loss like hemorrhage. The temporary and episodic changes with added physical pressures are extreme and require technologic support to permit performance in high altitude maneuvers. How well these support systems work depends upon an understanding of the physiology.\nAfter Aerospace Physiology I, the learner will be able to describe the organization of the cardiovascular system including the role of the heart in the circulation to the atrial and from the venous vessel system, and the special consideration for aerospace in the integrated responses to space and high performance.\nBlock IV: Pulmonary Physiology\nHumans acutely exposed to altitude adjust homeostatically to the low oxygen environment with primarily ventilatory adjustments. Over time, the human response can reduce the impact of the altered environment by acid-base adjustments, increases in oxygen carrying capacity, and cardiac output. The former is relevant for air travelers and pilots and the latter to prolonged travel.\nAfter Aerospace Physiology I, the learner will describe the sequence of gas exchange from the alveolar blood vessel (V/Q) interface in the lungs to the cells, in the context of the control systems that regulate tidal volume and frequency.\nBlock V: Renal Physiology\nThe kidney is a regulator primarily of acid-base and electrolyte levels. Per se it is not affected by barometric pressures or environmental forcing. However, it is key to volume balance, responding to changes in cardiac output and blood pressure, and may misbehave in the instance of hyperventilation to hypoxia. The renal adjustment is slow an"

Whole body effects of individual environmental challenges (acceleration, hypoxia and hyperoxia, special disorientation, radiation and thermal challenges) and methods to identify and promote resilience will be considered. Forward leaning incident investigations require appreciation of behavioral interventions, measurable and modifiable human factors, and physiologic forensics and root cause analysis.\nBlock I: Normal Physiology in Abnormal Environments\nThis block uses examples of integrative physiology that result from the effects of acceleration, hypoxia and imposed hyperoxia, radiation exposures from high altitude and space travel, and adverse thermal environments.\nBlock II: Enhancing Resilience to the Physiological Stressors of Aerospace Environments\nThis block considers the behavioral factors that might enhance or mitigate human responses including nutrition, exercise, adequate sleep, and drug mitigation.\nBlock III: Human Factors within Extreme Environments\nThis block presents the \"Human Factors\" as found in the FAA Classification system and its utility in examining errors or incidents. Such issues lead to a formal approach to the root causes for an unexpected problem or accident, including the impacts of fatigue, cognitive processing, physiologic capability, and the human interface with technology.\nBlock IV: Aerospace Forensics\nThis block expands on Block III to address the forensic process rather than error assessment. Operational mishaps initiate a rather formal process of investigation and a 360 degree consideration of proximal cause. Examples of such events are presented to teams who will come to their conclusion and compare it with the final outcome, contrasting and accepting alternative explanatory models.\nPrereq:PHOL\u00a0421or (PHOL\u00a0481andPHOL\u00a0482)."

In this seminar, through readings, discussion, and writing, we will focus on a range of examples in which scientific questions have been adjudicated in the courtroom. Questions to be considered are: How are judges or juries supposed to evaluate questions of science? Who decides what counts as science, or what counts as scientific consensus? What counts as expertise, and what counts as evidence when it comes to deciding a case that hinges on questions of science? Are legal facts ever different from scientific facts? By the end of the course, students will have a new understanding of the role of science in the modern world and the complicated intersections between science, society, and the law.\nOffered asHSTY\u00a0213andPOSC\u00a0213.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "Regardless of how the Arctic is defined, major environmental challenges that accompany climate change, melting sea ice and human activity there give rise to disasters that engender major changes such as forced migration and the destruction of property. At the same time, the instruments available to address Arctic environmental issues are in need of reform. Therefore, the challenge of Arctic governance is that what is essentially a set of regional issues has become problematized as a global call for action. Nonetheless, the causes of these physical changes embedded in industrial society do not emanate from the region--but rather from behaviors of peoples and industries far removed from them.\nThis course takes a comprehensive view of the region, and explores the evolving concept of the Arctic through the lens of international relations with a particular emphasis on traditional national security, scientific cooperation, and political economy. We will consider future challenges and potential avenues of resolution that fall across disciplinary lines. Thus, students are expected to prepare for class by doing the assigned readings--there are very few lectures. At the same time, we will carve out time to review and reflect on composing, writing, and revising in order to produce the best possible research. Counts as a Communication Intensive course."

It is a resource, a motivation, and an end unto itself.  This course will examine the role of money in politics, with particular emphasis on American politics.  We will discuss the role of money in elections, in the policy-making process, and what it means for representation.  The course will begin with the question of the role that financial considerations play in public opinion and voting behavior.  We will then address the role that money plays in election results, both in terms of its role in financing campaigns, and the relationship between the state of the economy and election results.  Finally, we will discuss the policy-making process.  In that context, we will address the role that interest groups play in the process, and how the quest for economic benefits for one's constituency motivates the behavior of elected officials.

The majority of the semester will focus on the politics of guns. We'll cover the history of the gun control debate in the U.S. and examine the various roles that interest groups -- including both the NRA and gun control advocacy organizations --play in it. We'll think about how gun politics are connected to and impact partisan politics. We will also explore the relationship between gun politics and mass political behavior, discussing who buys guns (and why) and the social and psychological meaning they carry for many Americans. Related, we'll ponder how guns are linked to a range of politically-relevant identities individuals hold, including those related to race and gender. Finally, we will examine gun policy, critically assessing the pros and cons of various proposed solutions to the U.S. gun violence problem. Counts as a Disciplinary Communication course.

Major concerns of the course include the political meanings and import of \"sex,\" \"gender,\" and \"politics;\" the relationship between women and the state; how women organize collectively to influence state policies; and how the state facilitates and constrains women's access to and exercise of political power.  The course is organized around four foci central to the study of women and politics.  The first section of the course focuses on the meanings of \"women,\" \"gender,\" and \"politics.\"  In this section, we will consider how these concepts intersect and the ways in which each may be used to deepen our understanding of the workings of governments and political systems, and of women's relative political powerlessness.  The second section of the course employs these concepts to understand the (re) emergence of the US feminist movement, its meanings, practices, and goals, and its transformation across US political history.  In the third section, we turn to conventional electoral politics, focusing on women's candidacies, their campaigns, and women's voting behavior.

These trends may have negative consequences for democracy in the United States, contributing to a political system that often responds to the preferences of the wealthiest Americans while frequently ignoring the views of most ordinary citizens. This course, in diverse ways, explores the political causes and consequences of rising inequality, especially with regards to who has political power. We will begin by examining the contours of inequality in the U.S. while also exploring the various ways that power manifests itself in politics. We'll then explore the relationship between wealth and public policy outcomes in the United States, along with the ways that the very wealthiest Americans -- both individually and collectively -- work to advance their policy views. We'll then explore how political and economic inequality are interrelated with race and social class. Finally, we will assess potential remedies to political and economic inequality.

Throughout, the region's history, geography, and culture are taken into account--for example, the European and indigenous legacies in Mexico and Per\u00fa, Bolivia, Chile, and Ecuador;  the Asian presence in Per\u00fa and Brazil; the African contributions to Cuba and Brazil; female heads of state, such as Nicaragua's Violeta Chamorro, Chile's Michelle Bachelet, Argentina's Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, Costa Rica's Laura Chinchilla, and Brazil's Dilma Rousseff.  Liberation Theology and the current Pope's worries about the declining number of Catholics in the region are also addressed. Today's multiparty democracy in Mexico, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's legacy in Venezuela, and Cuba's international humanitarian aid and ideological aims would not be possible without revolution(s) and populism. They are inevitably intertwined with ethnicity, gender, and religion.

    "description": "Technology is deeply political.  Nowhere is this statement more evident than in the realm of international relations, where governments perceive technology as a source of power and wealth and a symbol of relative position and modernity.  Yet for centuries skeptics have questioned the economic rationale of government technology policies.  Still, to this day, countries support emulation, innovation and a host of other strategies as means for catching up with leading nations or locking in current advantages.  What lies behind such policies?  What do they accomplish?  And what are the domestic and international politics surrounding them? After reading classic arguments, including texts by Adam Smith, Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List, students will consider 20th and 21st century debates and an array of experiments tried by poor, middle-income and rich countries.  Cases include the development of new industries; the imposition of sanctions; the dilemma of dual technologies and military spillovers; the forging of national champions; the reorganization of banks and the creation of international financial centers; the copying of regional clusters (e.g. Silicon Valley) and stock markets (e.g. the Nasdaq); and the extraterritorial extension of domestic regulation and governance techniques.\nOffered asPOSC\u00a0375andPOSC\u00a0475.

Their actions depend on their own values; conflict among political authorities, and on what is needed to perform specific tasks.  We will begin by discussing the challenges of organizing to do anything, or organization theory; turn to the peculiar political context of administration in the United States; and apply these understandings to specific government activities.

Why do some issues make it on to the agenda, while others do not?  Can we separate facts from values, or are both always contested?  We will examine how decision-making in a group introduces distinct challenges for policymaking.

Major concerns of the course include the political meanings and import of \"sex,\" \"gender,\" and \"politics;\" the relationship between women and the state; how women organize collectively to influence state policies; and how the state facilitates and constrains women's access to and exercise of political power.  The course is organized around four foci central to the study of women and politics.  The first section of the course focuses on the meanings of \"women,\" \"gender,\" and \"politics.\"  In this section, we will consider how these concepts intersect and the ways in which each may be used to deepen our understanding of the workings of governments and political systems, and of women's relative political powerlessness.  The second section of the course employs these concepts to understand the (re) emergence of the US feminist movement, its meanings, practices, and goals, and its transformation across US political history.  In the third section, we turn to conventional electoral politics, focusing on women's candidacies, their campaigns, and women's voting behavior.

    "description": "\"No state is forever strong or forever weak,\" said Han Feizi, China's great legalist philosopher.  He believed that as a country's conditions changed, the laws and institutions had to change to meet these new circumstances.  China today faces new circumstances that have caused deep and broad challenges to its people.  This has prompted serious debate among intellectuals, leaders, and average citizens about the possibility for and direction of political reform.  But what might that reform look like, and how would it be conceived, if it could overcome the current barriers?  This seminar will provide a fuller understanding of China's potential for political change by examining Chinese political though from Confucius, Mencius and Han Feizi through Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.  These and other political philosophies have influenced China's political culture, which will influence the form of any change.\nOffered asPOSC\u00a0353andPOSC\u00a0453."

The course engages classic scholarly texts to unpack the roots, processes, and outcomes of revolution and then apply them to specific historical cases. A core component of this course will deal with ethical and moral decision making under revolutionary and extraordinary political conditions. Why do people try to change the world when the costs can be so high? Under what conditions, if any, is it right to use violence to enact revolutionary change or to deny it? Is it right for an outside power to enter another country to influence a revolutionary situation? What does it mean to match one's political values to their moral values?

Nowhere is this statement more evident than in the realm of international relations, where governments perceive technology as a source of power and wealth and a symbol of relative position and modernity.  Yet for centuries skeptics have questioned the economic rationale of government technology policies.  Still, to this day, countries support emulation, innovation and a host of other strategies as means for catching up with leading nations or locking in current advantages.  What lies behind such policies?  What do they accomplish?  And what are the domestic and international politics surrounding them? After reading classic arguments, including texts by Adam Smith, Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List, students will consider 20th and 21st century debates and an array of experiments tried by poor, middle-income and rich countries.  Cases include the development of new industries; the imposition of sanctions; the dilemma of dual technologies and military spillovers; the forging of national champions; the reorganization of banks and the creation of international financial centers; the copying of regional clusters (e.g. Silicon Valley) and stock markets (e.g. the Nasdaq); and the extraterritorial extension of domestic regulation and governance techniques.\nOffered asPOSC\u00a0375andPOSC\u00a0475.

This course focuses on distinguishing pseudoscientific claims from scientific claims in clinical psychology. We will evaluate popular, and oftentimes controversial, methods, assessments, and treatments within the field of clinical science. Grounded in the fundamentals of scientific inquiry and research methods, students will sharpen critical thinking skills by evaluating pseudoscientific claims and learning to identify the characteristic features that distinguish pseudoscience and science. We will discuss the psychological issues associated with theories and practices such as false memories, projective testing, facilitated communication, the use of expert testimony, dissociative identity disorder, and harmful or unsupported treatments for psychiatric disorders. Additionally students will complete a semester long research project associated with pseudoscience in mental health. In groups, students will design and run their own experiments and present these data at the end of the semester.\nPrereq:PSCL\u00a0282."

We will also work to strengthen our general thinking and communicative abilities as we study the psychology of emotion.  Specifically, our goals will be to state theories and ideas clearly and concisely, to identify different parts of arguments and analyze the logic of these parts, to integrate the different aspects of emotion, and to generate new ideas based on the theories and research.

This course will: Recognize racism in the US as a significant cause of poor health, disease, and persistent dis-ease among Black Americans;  Explore the relationship between racism and health through a historic accounting of social, political, economic, and environmental conditions post-slavery through the current events of 2020; and, identify how, research, policy, practice, and advocacy can address anti-Black racism and promote health equity."

The course invites students to think comparatively and critically about the role of religion within broader cultural discourses (e.g., gender, politics, and the environment).\nInstead of surveying what were formerly called the \"world's great religions,\" this course builds religious literacy by examining religious practices within particular geographical and thematic areas. Through comparative case studies drawn from a diverse range of \"non-western\" cultures, students will learn about religions and spiritualities across the globe. These cultural touchstones will build core literacy in other cultures, positioning students to engage more fully in the religious and cultural diversity that they will encounter in their own lives and careers.\nAlongside these geographic case studies, the course will also examine key themes in the study of religion, such as diasporic transnationalism, liberation theology, and ritual practice. We will use these themes to tease out and debate some of the core theoretical and methodological challenges in the study of religion, including postcolonial critiques of the origin and history of the field of religious studies itself.\nTo be clear, religion is our subject, not our approach. Although students will find opportunities to reflect on their own spirituality/disbelief, the course does not presume any particular religious or non-religious perspective. Indeed, the study of religion is itself concerned not only with the world's religious traditions, but also with contemporary questions of skepticism, science, disbelief, and secularity.\nEvaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, regular short papers, a midterm exam, and a final take-home essay exam.

From debates about the veil to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, gendered concerns have been especially prominent in contemporary debates about Islam in the modern world.

How and why have Muslim women become so central to contemporary political debates? \n\nThis course explores each of these questions, while inviting students to construct alternative narratives around Islam, gender, and sexuality. This course begins by examining gender and sexuality in the foundational Islamic texts, the Qur'an and Sunna (the practice of the Prophet Muhammad), and pre-modern interpretations of these texts. The course then turns to marriage and divorce in Muslim jurisprudence, in order to examine themes such as women's spiritual capacities, female leadership, sexuality, and slavery. Next, we will turn to the headscarf as a lens though which to explore modern configurations of gender and sexuality, as they intersect with conceptions of national belonging, religious identity, and individual freedom.

In encountering differences -- in the form of religious experiences, ideas, narratives, traditions, texts, etc. -- we make sense of these differences through acts of translation. To think with the themes of religion and translation is to recognize that the world has always been multilingual. The task of translation carries not only linguistic but also ethical significance. \nIn this course, we ask: how does translation in this extended sense participate in the religious lives and experiences of people? How do we, as human, make sense of and connect with the other-than-human?

Students will also consider the challenges posed by, as well as the possibilities offered by the increasing diversity and plurality within the Christian tradition, as they examine the wider social, cultural, ethical, economic, and political dimensions of Christianity, and themes of community-making, identity constructions, and social movements in regions beyond Europe and North America, through both historical and contemporary perspectives. Students will also investigate the impact and implications of missionary expansion, religious reception, colonialism and imperialism, globalization, transnational migration, postcolonialism, and multiple belonging on the transformation of Christianity from a Eurocentric religious tradition to a truly global world religion.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "India, where over-the-top, melodramatic films dominate, produces more than 1,000 films a year. With lavish action sequences punctuated by periodic songs in picturesque locales, these films, popularly referred to as Bollywood, traditionally have been known for depicting imaginary worlds, very far from reality. Among these are movies that are deeply immersed in issues of religion, religious conflict, caste, and social injustice and that connect with gender and sexuality, and sexual orientation. This class will be looking at a number of Bollywood films with focal points of matters pertaining to social justice. Students will learn about the foundations of these inequalities and intolerances so that they can more completely understand the themes addressed in the movies. The class will thus focus on the religion(s) of cultures outside the United States. It will address in a substantive way ethnic, gender, sexual, religious, or other cultural practices outside the United States, so as to provide students with fresh perspectives on their own cultural assumptions, traditions, and experiences.\nOffered asETHS\u00a0243andRLGN\u00a0243andWGST\u00a0243.

From generative language models to video surveillance and identity detection to facial recognition, AI is becoming more and more embedded in our everyday lives. These AI technologies are increasingly built on our data, whether we are aware of it or not. In this praxis-oriented course, we will explore how data is fundamental to the development of AI technologies and develop practices for increased awareness of and participation in this data ecosystem. As we interrogate AI systems in everyday life through hands-on engagement with AI tools and their data pipelines, we will begin to construct a data citizenship model that can help us reclaim the power of collective responsibility in order to build a more just and sustainable socio-technical future.

How is religious sexual abuse different than non-religious contexts? What can survivors teach us about the resilience of the human spirit? What are the racial dynamics of the recent Roman Catholic crisis? What flaws has it exposed in our criminal justice system? \nTo answer questions like these, we will (i) begin the semester with anthropological studies of religion and trauma. Then we will (ii) examine grand jury investigations in the United States. Prepared by these theoretical and historical texts, we will (iii) evaluate case studies from the Roman Catholic context, including sexual abuse by nuns. We will use these examples to evaluate (iv) representations of the crisis in film and news media. Finally, we will (v) compare the Catholic crisis to recent sexual abuse scandals in American Jewish, Muslim, and Protestant communities. \nThe comparative literature will include readings by Veena Das (cultural anthropology), Levinas (philosophy), Kathryn Lofton (religious studies), Timothy Lytton (law), Fortune (theology), and Frawley-O'Dea (psychology). Primary sources will include excerpts from special prosecutors and grand juries in Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Massachusetts. Films will include \"Doubt\" and \"Spotlight.\" \nBy the end of the course, students will: - Know how to research and critique the legal, spiritual, and theoretical consequences of religious sexual abuse. - Be able to debate multiple theories of religion and trauma. - Be able to analyze data that is emotionally difficult and legally complex. \nOur seminars will include discussions, short writing assignments, collaborative work, and presentations.\nOffered asRLGN\u00a0252andWGST\u00a0252.

Along our journey, we examine how Jews have navigated their experiences as minorities in their many diaspora homelands, and how they have they adapted their cultural and religious practices to the various environments in which they have found themselves.  In addition to exploring their Jewishness vis-\u00e0-vis others, we also examine questions of exclusion and belonging that Jews have faced as they have encountered each another in recent decades through tourism, mass migration, globalization, and the internet. How do the world's varied Jewish groups - who are of different skin colors, who speak different languages, and who carry different historical memories - navigate ethnic divides, race relations, and religious diversity?

Bedrock moral concepts like free will, rights, and moral agency also have been questioned.  In light of such critiques, how can we best understand moral philosophy and religious ethics?  Is ethics primarily informed by nature or by culture?  Or is ethics informed by both?  This course examines 1) ways in which cognitive science--and related fields such as evolutionary biology--impact traditional moral perspectives, and 2) how the study of moral philosophy and comparative ethics forces reconsideration of broad cognitive science theories about the nature of ethics.  The course examines the concept of free will as a case study in applying these interpretive viewpoints.

Are the Muslim Jesus and the Christian Jesus the same person?  \n            \nThe primarily aim of this course is to introduce an image of Jesus little known outside the Arabic Islamic culture. It is an image that might be of interest to those who wish to understand how Jesus was perceived by a religious tradition which greatly revered him but rejected his divinity. Hence, the Jesus presented in this course will be similar in some ways to the Jesus in the Christian Gospels, in others not. Why and how this Muslim tradition of Jesus arose will be also discussed in this course.  Jesus Through Islamic Lens will draw from various Islamic texts to provide a comprehensive selection of excerpts pertaining to the life and moral teachings of Jesus. Approaching Christ from an Islamic perspective, this course will offer the students a rare opportunity to understand the significance of Jesus in Islam  and to gain a better understanding of the faith, not only as it contrasts with Christianity but also as it compares. \n\nIn this course we will try to respond to these questions: What role does Jesus have in Islam?  What does the Quran say about Him? What does it not say?  Why are Muslims repulsed by the idea that Jesus is the Son of God, fully God and fully man?  What do Muslims have in mind when they acknowledge Jesus as virgin-born? \n \nThis course also requires reading literature that pertains to the history of Islam, its theology and its culture, and because of its emphasis on an area of the world historically distinct from the West (or European culture), the course will fulfill the Global and Cultural Diversity requirement.

Scholars and activists, especially those interested in racial and gender equity, over the past two decades have raised interest in a broad set of contemplative practices that can address suffering and social justice issues in teaching, research and activism. What role does contemplative practices and spiritual activism play in efforts for social justice and social change? What might practices of social transformation look like when rooted in love and compassion? This course explores these questions among others, and examines the role of contemplative practices and spirituality for individuals and collectivities engaged in transformative social justice work.\nWe explore the increasing incorporation of contemplative practices and 'self-recovery' approaches into current social justice movements including Black Lives Matter, indigenous land claims, feminism, LGBTQ rights, etc. In turn, we also examine how activists bring new insights and questions to traditional practices and use practices rooted in decolonizing efforts. In particular, we focus on the work of contemporary feminist, womanist and women of color scholars and activists.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "In premodern Japan, it was not only death and mourning ritual and practice that could pacify the spirit of the deceased, but also language. Authors consciously crafted the words of their works to simultaneously express the grief associated with longing and pacify the spirits of the dead. These words are called kotodama (power of words). From as far back as the eighth-century Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters) and Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan) textual representations of mourning were linked with special uses of language and spirit pacification. At the death of Ame-no-wakahiko (a mythological god), his parents constructed a mourning hut and performed songs to secure his spirit in the afterworld. As several authors have demonstrated, from kotodama in the mid-eighth-century poetic anthology Man'y'sh, (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) to linked verse (renga) in medieval Japan, carefully constructed literary language also had a place in ritual pacification of the spirits of the dead. Words were not simple expressions of grief; they held power. \nAll material is in English translation. The course is conducted in English.

Others with an interest in the intersection of Buddhism and cognitive science, such as Robert Wright in Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment (2017), argue that non-supernatural aspects of Buddhism, such as the benefits of mindfulness meditation and the nature of the (non-)self, are affirmed by cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. The notion that at least some aspects of Buddhism are \"true\" in relation to contemporary cognitive scientific views of mind and brain has attracted considerable attention from both Buddhist practitioners and cognitive scientists.\nThis seminar explores Buddhist and cognitive science perspectives on issues such as embodied cognition, consciousness, mind, self and personal identity, theory of mind, morality, representation, and language. We start with a general overview of Buddhist philosophy, and then turn to specific readings on Buddhist concepts in relation to similar concepts found in the cognitive science literature. For instance, we will explore the Buddhist concept of no permanent self or soul (an-tman). This idea resonates with Daniel Dennett's notion of the \"narrative self\" and the cognitive neuroscience view that there is no neurological center of self or experience.\nAlthough the specific concepts covered will vary in each iteration of this course, readings will always be drawn from both Buddhist primary and secondary readings, and from the cognitive science literature.\nOffered asCOGS\u00a0348,COGS\u00a0448,RLGN\u00a0348andRLGN\u00a0448.

Considering gender as a cultured way of being in, understanding, and interacting with the world within which we are situated, this seminar queries the conceptualization of gender and sexuality in Buddhism and Buddhist communities across space and time, with particular emphasis on those located in Asia. What does it mean to be a woman, a man, someone of the third sex, or none of the above? What are the Buddhist idea(l)s about femininity, masculinity, and personhood? How do these idea(l)s change with translation and transmission? We will explore together the theories and practices of gender and sexuality expressed by Buddhist communities from its beginnings to the present day. Buddhism's major conversation partners throughout history -- Hinduism, Confucianism, and Daoism -- will also be brought into discussion.

    "description": "With poor communities and individuals across the world aspiring for higher standards of living and quality of life, monolithic development strategies are proving to be insufficient.  Microenterprise and social entrepreneurship are among the latest strategies for poverty alleviation.  New strategies that are grass-roots, multi-dimensional, entrepreneurial, and engage stakeholders as partners are gaining ground.  They seek to fundamentally transform the roles and relationships of the stakeholders in the economy.  While social entrepreneurship is revolutionizing the practice of development work, the micro-enterprise sector plays an important role for some of the poorest sectors of society who gain employment, connection to the market, and opportunities for innovation through it.  In this course, we will examine social entrepreneurship, the change it brought about in how development is viewed, conceived, and implemented.  Some of the examples that will provide core content include economic development strategies that promote asset building among the poor; Mandragon in Spain (and other similar institutions from across the world), Greyston Bakery (and other similar examples from around the United States) and Evergreen Cooperative (and other relevant local examples)."

Violence is a complex social problem that requires a multi-disciplinary approach to prevention and intervention.  This class will address violence at multiple levels (individual, family, community) and as it occurs across multiple systems (e.g., mental health, substance use, criminal justice, and education).  A public health model examines a particular behavior with respect to prevention and intervention at multiple levels. A public health approach requires an understanding of etiology, developmental course, and outcomes related to risk and protective factors.  This course will utilize up to date research on various forms of violent behavior and comorbidities as they occur at the individual, family, and community levels (e.g. gun violence, human trafficking, mental health, substance use).  Local, national and international perspectives on violence and violent behavior will be addressed.  Because violence perpetration and victimization are most problematic for children, youth and young adults, the focus of the course will be on those age groups, although we will also discuss problems of violence among adults (e.g. sexual violence, offender reentry).  Attention will be given to new areas of research such as the neurobiology of violent behavior.  Individual differences, culture, and vulnerabilities related to violence perpetration and victimization will be explored. The course will discuss ways that violence affects individuals, families, systems, cultures, and society as a whole and the role of social work and public health in addressing violence of various types."

It provides foundations in the socially constructed nature of theory and social 'problems' and in historical changes in conceptual and theoretical perspectives on human society, interactions, and policy in the social realm. Domains of interest encompass a range of theoretical perspectives and provide the opportunity for exploring the theoretical and meta-theoretical assumptions and models that frame social welfare and social science scholarship, research, and policy.  \nThe overarching goal of this course is to help you develop a working knowledge of how theory, including metatheoretical assumptions and mid-level 'explanatory' theories shape social welfare and social science scholarship, research, and policy. Reviewing, critiquing, refining, and integrating theories is central to this process and thus we will devote much of the course to these tasks. Also central to this process if the linking of 'levels of theory' (i.e. metatheoretical assumptions; grand theory; and mid-level 'explanatory' theory) to the applied, i.e. contemporary social work practice and social welfare policy. To this end, the major assignment provides students with the opportunity for in-depth study of theoretical developments in a social welfare research domain of personal interest. Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on critical thinking, collegial engagement, and the conventions of formal scholarly practice."

We will apply this framework to topics such as maternity leave, child care, income assistance, and marriage promotion.  We will compare U.S. policies to those of other industrialized countries, especially those in Italy. You will end the semester by conducting research on a social policy topic that we have not covered during the semester from understanding the initial social problem all the way through to making a policy recommendation to help you learn to explore a new topic independently. Central to the course are the intersections between families and governments via policy outputs, and the roles that citizens and family professionals can play in improving them. \nUsing UNICEF resources, located in Florence, Italy, we will delve into evidence-based approaches for ameliorating suffering in young families across the globe. Using Florence as a classroom, we will explore differences in family life between the U.S. and Italy as a means to understand the ways in which the state must respond to differing cultures and needs. At the Innocenti Museum, in the same building as UNICEF's research offices, we will see an orphanage that began operations in 1445 and functioned as an orphanage and hospital until 1875, making it the oldest public institution in Italy.

Medical sociology emerged as a distinct field of study in the 1950s in part due to prominent studies of medical education such as The Student Physician by Robert K. Merton and Howard Becker's Boys in White.  Since then, sociologists and other social scientists have written extensively about how issues of race, gender, aging and ethnicity are tied to issues of medical education, medical training, medical socialization and physician decision-making.  Using a life course perspective, this course will examine how lives in medicine change over time; in particular, we'll study changing workforce patterns, physician satisfaction, and burnout.  Other topics to be covered include contemporary ethical issues and alternative professional health careers.  The course provides an overview of how medicine and medical practice have a profound influence on--and are influenced by--social, cultural, political and economic forces.

Students will examine issues such as the social significance of money, the effect of social networks on labor market outcomes, the success and failure of firms, tips and gifts, informal markets and the trade of illicit goods, as well as topics such as immigration and globalization.  Our investigations into these diverse topics reveal how economic phenomena, economic systems and processes are shaped by social networks, cultural understandings and relations of power.  Throughout the course students will examine how economic relations are facilitated--created, maintained, transformed, and constrained--by social relations, revealing that economic life and behavior is just as social as religion, family or education.\nPrereq:SOCI\u00a0101."

    "description": "Technology has played a significant role in the evolution of medical science and treatment.  While we often think about progress in terms of the practical application of, say, imaging to the diagnosis and monitoring of disease, technology is increasingly expected to improve the organization and delivery of healthcare services, too.  Information technology plays a key role in the transformation of administrative support systems (finance and administration), clinical information systems (information to support patient care), and decision support systems (managerial decision-making).  This introductory graduate course provides the student with the opportunity to gain insight and situational experience with clinical information systems (CIS).  Often considered synonymous with electronic medical records, the \"art\" of CIS more fundamentally examines the effective use of data and information technology to assist in the migration away from paper-based systems and improve organizational performance.  In this course we examine clinical information systems in the context of (A) operational and strategic information needs, (B) information technology and analytic tools for workflow design, and (C) subsequent implementation of clinical information systems in patient care.  Legal and ethical issues are explored.  The student learns the process of \"plan, design, implement\" through hands-on applications to select CIS problems, while at the same time gaining insights and understanding of the impacts placed on patients and health care providers.\nOffered asEBME\u00a0473,MGTE\u00a0473, andSYBB\u00a0421."

Innovation is a driver of regional economic development and wealth creation in organizational units ranging in size from the start-up to the Fortune 500 companies.  In a broader context, the pace of translational research leading to product and service innovation is highly interdisciplinary, thus, new products and services result from team efforts, marked by a systematic, structured approach to bringing new medical technologies to market and impacting patient care.  In this course we examine medical technology innovations in the context of (A) addressing unmet clinical needs, (B) the process of inventing new medical devices and instruments, and (C) subsequent implementation of these advances in patient care.

The dramatic texts that we shall study include the fragments of early Latin drama, selected comedies by Plautus and Terence, and the tragedies of Seneca. We shall also consider Greek and Roman literature that comments on Roman theatrical practices. These works will be read for their literary merits and theatrical possibilities, while at the same time examining them for what they can tell us about Roman civilization.

All semester we read the plays as literature composed for performance. We study literary elements within the plays and theatrical possibilities inherent in the texts. As we read the plays, we pay close attention to the historical context and look for what each play can tell us about myth, religion, ethics, and society in ancient Athens. Finally, we give attention to the way these tragic dramas and the theater in which they were performed have continued to inspire literature and theater for thousands of years. Lectures provide historical background on the playwrights, the plays, the mythic and historical background, and possible interpretation of the texts as literature and as performance pieces. Students discuss the plays that they read in class.

Students in Theater in Ancient Rome will read a significant number of ancient Roman plays in modern English translation and study non-literary theatrical entertainment of the Roman Republic and Empire, that may include mime and pantomime, gladiatorial shows, political speeches, courtroom drama, and various other spectacles. The dramatic texts that we shall study include the fragments of early Latin drama, selected comedies by Plautus and Terence, and the tragedies of Seneca. We shall also consider Greek and Roman literature that comments on Roman theatrical practices. These works will be read for their literary merits and theatrical possibilities, while at the same time examining them for what they can tell us about Roman civilization. Similarly, when studying the non-literary theatrical works we shall examine historical and theatrical context including archaeological evidence from theaters and amphitheaters and material remains (masks, depictions of actors and gladiators on vases, terra cotta lamps, mosaics, etc.). Finally, while the majority of the course focuses on drama originally written in Latin and theatrical entertainments performed in ancient Rome, the course may include a brief survey of selected post-classical works indebted to the tradition of Roman drama and theater. Authors that may be studied include Hrotsvitha, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, and the legacy of Roman drama and theater in contemporary stage and cinema such as Sondheim's A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Thus a secondary concern will be to consider how and in what ways the legacy of Roman drama and theater has continued to shape the dramatic arts since antiquity. \nOffered asCLSC\u00a0322,CLSC\u00a0422,THTR\u00a0322,THTR\u00a0422,WLIT\u00a0322, andWLIT\u00a0422.

To what extent does natural selection shape our behavior today?  Are humans naturally monogamous?  Why do conflicts arise even in our most intimate relationships?  Is human behavior ultimately in the service of reproductive success, ensuring that our genes are passed into the next generation?  This course reviews the history of evolutionary theories of mind and behavior, as well as current ideas about the ecological and genetic components of behavior.  We will examine key principles of neurobiology, sociobiology, and evolutionary psychology to critically evaluate evolutionary interpretations of human behaviors, including those comprising cultural traditions and social institutions.  Specific topics to be addressed include human mate choice, parenting strategies, interpersonal conflict, and altruism.

    "description": "This seminar provides students an opportunity to explore U.S. national parks and their history of displaying both nature and culture.  This discussion-based, writing- and research-focused class requires students to examine a park system that is both extraordinarily popular and rife with controversy.  We begin with several recurring questions: Where did the national parks idea come from?  How has the park mission evolved and adapted?  Can parks be \"read\" as texts, and if so, how does our point of view determine what we see?  How do parks arrange displays of cultural and natural worlds, and how do they display interactions therein?  How can changing park philosophies be reflected in their physical apparatus and infrastructure?\n\nStudents will participate in regular class discussions, occasionally lead these same discussions, complete formal writing assignments, and develop a final research project.  The course readings will alternate between historical and present-day selections, so that we explore the history of U.S. national parks while simultaneously considering challenges and controversies that matter very much today.  Early readings will include John Muir and Gifford Pinchot; current trends will be explored in the writings of William Cronon, Alfred Runte, and Jennifer Price, among many others.  We will view significant portions of Ken Burns' recent PBS series The National Parks: America's Best Idea.\n\nThe ultimate \"text\" for the class, however, is an actual national park.  Each student will choose a national park as the basis for their semester-long project.  Students will begin with description and history of their park, and then they will explore controversies or other issues in the park, developing their own argument.  Next, students will have a chance to play architect/landscaper/park-superintendent, as they propose a change to the park that would address an existing problem or enhance the visitors' experience.  Finally, students will gather these pieces into a single coherent project, submitting a 10-15 page final essay as well as producing an engaging class presentation.\nPrereq: Passing letter grade in a SAGES First Seminar, Academic Inquiry (AIQS) Seminar, or FSTS 100."

    "description": "Around 1439, Johannes Gutenberg invented the moveable type printing press, a technological development that altered the world by ushering in an era of mass, reproducible communication.  For nearly 500 years, print technologies have dominated communications.  Scholars have shown that print's ability to disseminate information led to revolutions in art, science and politics.  In short, print technologies have largely defined what it means to be a thinking and communicating human being.  The emergence of digital technologies has altered communications in ways that are only now being understood.  This course examines how developments in digital technologies impact communication practices by threatening print's historic stronghold.  Consequently, the course also explores what impact new technologies have on human identity.  We will consider the historical development of display technologies (printed materials and digital screens) to understand what is at stake in the move from print to digital communication.  We will then investigate current phenomena associated with Web 2.0, including blogs and social networks, in order to understand how our communication choices construct and allow for our public and private identities.  Additionally, the course will examine new display technologies, such as iPhones and Kindles, that allow for the possibly constant dissemination of those identities.  Finally, we will hypothesize about how digital technologies force us to conceive of human identity differently from the ways that print invites.\nPrereq: Passing letter grade in a SAGES First Seminar, Academic Inquiry (AIQS) Seminar, or FSTS 100."

    "description": "The goal of this course is to encourage students to be well informed and critical consumers of the media reports about the influence of genes and environment on human behavior. This course involves the book by Matt Ridley titled, \"Genome: The autobiography of a species in 23 chapters.\" Ridley has a Ph.D. in zoology, worked as a journalist, science editor, and national newspaper columnist. The book devotes a chapter to each pair of human chromosomes. Each chapter focuses on the role of a gene. Ridley's book was published in 1999; therefore, students will conduct their own research to update each of the chapters in Ridley's book. The first few weeks of class will be used to provide a background on genetics research through field trips and guest lectures from CWRU genetic researchers. We will have several writing workshops spread throughout the semester to offer \"Just in Time\" tips needed to write critical evaluations and literature reviews. Each student will present twice during the semester. The first oral presentation will revolve around a summary, critical evaluation, and an update of the human trait presented in the Ridley book on their assigned chromosome. The presentation will be about 15 minutes with 5 minutes left for questions. Students not presenting will be assigned one of the three chromosomes (chapters) covered that day and they will each write a seminar question to pose to the class. In addition, each student will also serve as a reviewer for one of the presentations to provide constructive feedback to the presenter. The second presentation will consist of new material found by each student about genes on their chromosome. They must find another trait on their chromosome and present the most current information available on that trait. In place of a final exam, each student will turn in a research paper on their assigned chromosome. We will build these papers throughout the semester with a series of graded \"checkpoint\" assignments.\nPrereq: Passing letter grade in a SAGES First Seminar, Academic Inquiry (AIQS) Seminar, or FSTS 100."

How do we explain the centuries-old correlation that medicine has made between creativity and mental illness?  Which past and present psychiatric treatments have been beneficial and which harmful?  How did Darwin's theory of evolution affect theories of mental illness (and how does it continue to do so with the advent of evolutionary psychology)?  How have changing philosophies of science affected the research and practice of psychology?  How and why do the sciences of the mind--psychiatry, psychoanalysis, clinical psychology, psychopharmacology, the cognitive neurosciences--claim so much scientific authority and exert influence over our lives today?

This course will begin by studying the human face as an anatomic construction of hard and soft tissue skeletal components. We will discuss how we use anatomic facial features to recognize individuals. One homework exercise will be to construct faces using an FBI identikit. Each student will create an FBI composite sketch of their own face. Seminar time will then be used to view each sketch and try to match the sketch with the seminar participant. Discussion will focus on how facial anatomy is similar or different. Following this introduction, the seminar will shift focus from anatomy to sociology. We will discuss facial attractiveness and beauty.

    "description": "At the beginning of the Renaissance, about the year 1400, an important new theme arose in painting, sculpture and printmaking--the theme of art about art.  At a time when the status of artists in society was rising, new subjects began to appear in western European art that depicted both the artist and the process of making art.  Self portraits of artists, depictions of Saint Luke painting the Virgin Mary, images of women as artists and muses, classical and mythological stories of art making (Pygmalion and Galatea, Apelles painting the mistress of Alexander the Great), depictions of painting and sculpture studios and of art academies and instruction, scenes of art galleries and collections, still lifes about art, all reflected this new cultural interest in art as a topic in itself.  This seminar will look at individual works of art and subject types to understand what they tell us about the role of the arts and the changing status of the artist in the Renaissance and early modern period, up to the eve of the French Revolution, about 1789.  The works we study will thus be understood as symbolic indicators of social status and ideas about what art meant to European society.\nPrereq: Passing letter grade in a SAGES First Seminar, Academic Inquiry (AIQS) Seminar, or FSTS 100."

From debates about the veil to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, gendered concerns have been especially prominent in contemporary debates about Islam in the modern world. How are masculinity and femininity constructed in Muslim contexts? How have Muslim thinkers interpreted Islamic scriptures with respect to topics such as marriage, child custody, inheritance, and sexuality? In what ways do these interpretations reflect the political, economic, and social conditions in which they lived? How does gender structure authority and power in Muslim communities? How and why have Muslim women become so central to contemporary political debates? \n\nThis course explores each of these questions, while inviting students to construct alternative narratives around Islam, gender, and sexuality. This course begins by examining gender and sexuality in the foundational Islamic texts, the Qur'an and Sunna (the practice of the Prophet Muhammad), and pre-modern interpretations of these texts. The course then turns to marriage and divorce in Muslim jurisprudence, in order to examine themes such as women's spiritual capacities, female leadership, sexuality, and slavery. Next, we will turn to the headscarf as a lens though which to explore modern configurations of gender and sexuality, as they intersect with conceptions of national belonging, religious identity, and individual freedom.

A range of topics will be covered, including readings that discuss the variations of sexuality and the notions of sexual ''deviance\" in order to explore the cultural and societal variation that exists along the lines of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age and disability.\nOffered asSOCI\u00a0228andWGST\u00a0228.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "This course focuses on the connections between public policies and families and the values that enter into policy debates and family choices. It provides conceptual frameworks that can be used to identify and understand some of the influences underlying policy choices affecting families and also frameworks for evaluating the consequences of these choices for families of diverse structures, socio-economic statuses, and racial and ethnic backgrounds. We will apply this framework to topics such as maternity leave, child care, income assistance, and marriage promotion.  We will compare U.S. policies to those of other industrialized countries, especially those in Italy. You will end the semester by conducting research on a social policy topic that we have not covered during the semester from understanding the initial social problem all the way through to making a policy recommendation to help you learn to explore a new topic independently. Central to the course are the intersections between families and governments via policy outputs, and the roles that citizens and family professionals can play in improving them. \nUsing UNICEF resources, located in Florence, Italy, we will delve into evidence-based approaches for ameliorating suffering in young families across the globe. Using Florence as a classroom, we will explore differences in family life between the U.S. and Italy as a means to understand the ways in which the state must respond to differing cultures and needs. At the Innocenti Museum, in the same building as UNICEF's research offices, we will see an orphanage that began operations in 1445 and functioned as an orphanage and hospital until 1875, making it the oldest public institution in Italy. The building has been dedicated to the protection of children's rights and education since that time, and provides a backdrop for an early understanding of ways to think about family policy. \nOffered asSOCI\u00a0239andWGST\u00a0239.

    "description": "India, where over-the-top, melodramatic films dominate, produces more than 1,000 films a year. With lavish action sequences punctuated by periodic songs in picturesque locales, these films, popularly referred to as Bollywood, traditionally have been known for depicting imaginary worlds, very far from reality. Among these are movies that are deeply immersed in issues of religion, religious conflict, caste, and social injustice and that connect with gender and sexuality, and sexual orientation. This class will be looking at a number of Bollywood films with focal points of matters pertaining to social justice. Students will learn about the foundations of these inequalities and intolerances so that they can more completely understand the themes addressed in the movies. The class will thus focus on the religion(s) of cultures outside the United States. It will address in a substantive way ethnic, gender, sexual, religious, or other cultural practices outside the United States, so as to provide students with fresh perspectives on their own cultural assumptions, traditions, and experiences.\nOffered asETHS\u00a0243andRLGN\u00a0243andWGST\u00a0243.

How is religious sexual abuse different than non-religious contexts? What can survivors teach us about the resilience of the human spirit? What are the racial dynamics of the recent Roman Catholic crisis? What flaws has it exposed in our criminal justice system? \nTo answer questions like these, we will (i) begin the semester with anthropological studies of religion and trauma. Then we will (ii) examine grand jury investigations in the United States. Prepared by these theoretical and historical texts, we will (iii) evaluate case studies from the Roman Catholic context, including sexual abuse by nuns. We will use these examples to evaluate (iv) representations of the crisis in film and news media. Finally, we will (v) compare the Catholic crisis to recent sexual abuse scandals in American Jewish, Muslim, and Protestant communities. \nThe comparative literature will include readings by Veena Das (cultural anthropology), Levinas (philosophy), Kathryn Lofton (religious studies), Timothy Lytton (law), Fortune (theology), and Frawley-O'Dea (psychology). Primary sources will include excerpts from special prosecutors and grand juries in Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Massachusetts. Films will include \"Doubt\" and \"Spotlight.\" \nBy the end of the course, students will: - Know how to research and critique the legal, spiritual, and theoretical consequences of religious sexual abuse. - Be able to debate multiple theories of religion and trauma. - Be able to analyze data that is emotionally difficult and legally complex. \nOur seminars will include discussions, short writing assignments, collaborative work, and presentations.\nOffered asRLGN\u00a0252andWGST\u00a0252.

Scholars and activists, especially those interested in racial and gender equity, over the past two decades have raised interest in a broad set of contemplative practices that can address suffering and social justice issues in teaching, research and activism. What role does contemplative practices and spiritual activism play in efforts for social justice and social change? What might practices of social transformation look like when rooted in love and compassion? This course explores these questions among others, and examines the role of contemplative practices and spirituality for individuals and collectivities engaged in transformative social justice work.\nWe explore the increasing incorporation of contemplative practices and 'self-recovery' approaches into current social justice movements including Black Lives Matter, indigenous land claims, feminism, LGBTQ rights, etc. In turn, we also examine how activists bring new insights and questions to traditional practices and use practices rooted in decolonizing efforts. In particular, we focus on the work of contemporary feminist, womanist and women of color scholars and activists.

The first section of the course focuses on the meanings of \"women,\" \"gender,\" and \"politics.\"  In this section, we will consider how these concepts intersect and the ways in which each may be used to deepen our understanding of the workings of governments and political systems, and of women's relative political powerlessness.  The second section of the course employs these concepts to understand the (re) emergence of the US feminist movement, its meanings, practices, and goals, and its transformation across US political history.  In the third section, we turn to conventional electoral politics, focusing on women's candidacies, their campaigns, and women's voting behavior.

African feminist theory of scholars such as Filomina Steady, Cheikh Anta Diop, Buchi Emecheta, Ifi Amadiume, Obioma Nnameka, Oyeronko Oyewumi, and Calixthe Beyala will be studied and there will be some comparative analysis of Western theories to show how African feminisms are clearly distinct.

It is commonly believed that African women were defined for a long time according to constructs of Western anthropology.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "From concepts of premodern warriors calling out their names before doing hand-to-hand combat to modern salary men crushing the world with their economic prowess, samurai have come to be an iconic image of the Japanese people. Throughout the semester we will pay particular attention to the central themes in the historiography of warrior society, roughly, the years between ca. 1110 and 1850 C.E. We will investigate how these documents were translated by modern societies, both east and west, in samurai film.\nStudents will explore the category of \"samurai\" through reading selections from The Tale of the Heike, as well as selected Noh plays, legal documents, travel diaries, autobiographies, short stories, and historical texts. In addition, we will investigate other genres contributing to the construction of the idea of \"samurai,\" such as film.  This seminar will closely examine the concept of \"samurai,\" particularly its connection to the Japanese identity using an interdisciplinary context of the arts, history, religion, and literature. We will also explore the ways in which daimyo (feudal lords), authors, Buddhist officials, and filmmakers throughout the world created, shaped, and altered the ideal image of the samurai. Key to understanding the concept of samurai will be wrestling with questions of authorship, spirit pacification, nationality, and patronage, with specific focus on the Japanese relationship with Western nations and cultures.\nWe will focus on language and its role in legitimizing the global concepts of \"samurai\" and \"bushido.\" This class will provide additional insight geared toward the cultural study of linguistic identities beyond those informed by the English language and will include terms expressed in Japanese. Many of the resources used in this course will be translated from the Japanese, allowing us to consider Naoki Sakai's theories of enunciation/ translation/ subjectivity, Haruo Shirane's theory of reception, and Michael Emmerich's theory of replacement. Especially important will be to focus on terms in Japanese with no, or poor, English equivalent (such as samurai, shogun, daimyo, bushido, etc.) but with clear images in the English-speaking imagination(s).\nThe instructor will provide background information on political, cultural, and religious history. Class sessions will be conducted in English and combine lectures, discussion, audio-visual materials, and creative as well as analytical writing exercises.

How do ideas of sacred space explicit in Jerusalem's ancient authority compare to Tel Aviv's claims as a modern city, and Jaffa's status as a historical center? How are notions of exile and homeland, always central to space and identity, transformed as they are grounded in actual geographic sites?

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "Modern anime and manga authors and artists captivate audiences with rich stories and stylized art. This course investigates the origins of these stories by engaging premodern Japanese texts (in English language translation) and modern literary theory. Throughout the semester we will pay particular attention to commonalties among these literatures and narrative genres, as well as the extent they differ due to temporal/socio/religio/political concerns. Western and Asian literary theories, especially those concerning topics of translation, replacement, negotiation with classics, and gender and sexuality will also be extensively explored. We will interpret the historic human endeavor of story telling within the contexts of time and space and through a critical self-awareness of our own positions in the modern world.\nStudents will prepare individual research projects and be responsible for finding and presenting primary sources and secondary research. The instructor will provide background information on political, cultural, and religious history as well as present on details of literary theory. The aim is to encourage students to critically analyze the modern perception of past events. Every topic will be addressed in three phases. First, the students will discover historical events, literature, and people through reading primary sources in English translation. In a second phase, we will see how these stories are depicted in movies, animation, or manga. Finally, students will perform research to explore the differences between the premodern sources and their modern adaptation and determine how we can use such a comparison to critically analyze the way modern storytellers recreate the past.\nClass sessions will combine lectures, discussion, and audio- visual materials.\nOffered asJAPN\u00a0315andWLIT\u00a0315.

All semester we read the plays as literature composed for performance. We study literary elements within the plays and theatrical possibilities inherent in the texts. As we read the plays, we pay close attention to the historical context and look for what each play can tell us about myth, religion, ethics, and society in ancient Athens. Finally, we give attention to the way these tragic dramas and the theater in which they were performed have continued to inspire literature and theater for thousands of years. Lectures provide historical background on the playwrights, the plays, the mythic and historical background, and possible interpretation of the texts as literature and as performance pieces. Students discuss the plays that they read in class. The course has three examinations and a final project that includes writing an essay and staging a monologue or scene from one of the tragedies.\nOffered asCLSC\u00a0319,CLSC\u00a0419,THTR\u00a0319,THTR\u00a0419,WLIT\u00a0319, andWLIT\u00a0419.

Students in Theater in Ancient Rome will read a significant number of ancient Roman plays in modern English translation and study non-literary theatrical entertainment of the Roman Republic and Empire, that may include mime and pantomime, gladiatorial shows, political speeches, courtroom drama, and various other spectacles. The dramatic texts that we shall study include the fragments of early Latin drama, selected comedies by Plautus and Terence, and the tragedies of Seneca. We shall also consider Greek and Roman literature that comments on Roman theatrical practices. These works will be read for their literary merits and theatrical possibilities, while at the same time examining them for what they can tell us about Roman civilization. Similarly, when studying the non-literary theatrical works we shall examine historical and theatrical context including archaeological evidence from theaters and amphitheaters and material remains (masks, depictions of actors and gladiators on vases, terra cotta lamps, mosaics, etc.). Finally, while the majority of the course focuses on drama originally written in Latin and theatrical entertainments performed in ancient Rome, the course may include a brief survey of selected post-classical works indebted to the tradition of Roman drama and theater. Authors that may be studied include Hrotsvitha, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, and the legacy of Roman drama and theater in contemporary stage and cinema such as Sondheim's A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Thus a secondary concern will be to consider how and in what ways the legacy of Roman drama and theater has continued to shape the dramatic arts since antiquity. \nOffered asCLSC\u00a0322,CLSC\u00a0422,THTR\u00a0322,THTR\u00a0422,WLIT\u00a0322, andWLIT\u00a0422.

    "description": "In premodern Japan, it was not only death and mourning ritual and practice that could pacify the spirit of the deceased, but also language. Authors consciously crafted the words of their works to simultaneously express the grief associated with longing and pacify the spirits of the dead. These words are called kotodama (power of words). From as far back as the eighth-century Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters) and Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan) textual representations of mourning were linked with special uses of language and spirit pacification. At the death of Ame-no-wakahiko (a mythological god), his parents constructed a mourning hut and performed songs to secure his spirit in the afterworld. As several authors have demonstrated, from kotodama in the mid-eighth-century poetic anthology Man'y'sh, (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) to linked verse (renga) in medieval Japan, carefully constructed literary language also had a place in ritual pacification of the spirits of the dead. Words were not simple expressions of grief; they held power. \nAll material is in English translation. The course is conducted in English.

    "units": "3 Units",
    "description": "This course provides students the opportunity to read a significant number of ancient Greek tragedies in modern English translations. We read, study, and discuss selected works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, as well as selected criticism, ancient and modern, of these plays. All semester we read the plays as literature composed for performance. We study literary elements within the plays and theatrical possibilities inherent in the texts. As we read the plays, we pay close attention to the historical context and look for what each play can tell us about myth, religion, ethics, and society in ancient Athens. Finally, we give attention to the way these tragic dramas and the theater in which they were performed have continued to inspire literature and theater for thousands of years. Lectures provide historical background on the playwrights, the plays, the mythic and historical background, and possible interpretation of the texts as literature and as performance pieces. Students discuss the plays that they read in class. The course has three examinations and a final project that includes writing an essay and staging a monologue or scene from one of the tragedies.\nOffered asCLSC\u00a0319,CLSC\u00a0419,THTR\u00a0319,THTR\u00a0419,WLIT\u00a0319, andWLIT\u00a0419.

    "description": "This course is designed as a continuation of and companion to CLSC/THTR/WLIT\u00a0319/419 Greek Tragedy: Plays and Performance in Ancient Athens, although it may be taken without having taken, or before having taken, that course. Students in Theater in Ancient Rome will read a significant number of ancient Roman plays in modern English translation and study non-literary theatrical entertainment of the Roman Republic and Empire, that may include mime and pantomime, gladiatorial shows, political speeches, courtroom drama, and various other spectacles. The dramatic texts that we shall study include the fragments of early Latin drama, selected comedies by Plautus and Terence, and the tragedies of Seneca. We shall also consider Greek and Roman literature that comments on Roman theatrical practices. These works will be read for their literary merits and theatrical possibilities, while at the same time examining them for what they can tell us about Roman civilization. Similarly, when studying the non-literary theatrical works we shall examine historical and theatrical context including archaeological evidence from theaters and amphitheaters and material remains (masks, depictions of actors and gladiators on vases, terra cotta lamps, mosaics, etc.). Finally, while the majority of the course focuses on drama originally written in Latin and theatrical entertainments performed in ancient Rome, the course may include a brief survey of selected post-classical works indebted to the tradition of Roman drama and theater. Authors that may be studied include Hrotsvitha, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, and the legacy of Roman drama and theater in contemporary stage and cinema such as Sondheim's A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Thus a secondary concern will be to consider how and in what ways the legacy of Roman drama and theater has continued to shape the dramatic arts since antiquity. \nOffered asCLSC\u00a0322,CLSC\u00a0422,THTR\u00a0322,THTR\u00a0422,WLIT\u00a0322, andWLIT\u00a0422.
